Many educators, researchers, voices for quality education for all have come to create their educational videos and share those with community members, peers, and learners from industries. Many subjects and topics like Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning have gained has huge popularity in the market because they have brought disruption in the existing businesses and knowledge is openly available in the market. If you have time and money, then it makes sense to join some full-time or part-time course from some good university and learn these subjects systematically in depth and detail. But, if time or/and money is the issue, and you know what you want to learn, then there are many YouTube channels. From there you can learn everything you need to become a good ML Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, DL Engineer, NLP Engineer, etc.</p><p>During my Masters in Data Science and post that, I have benefited hugely from many such YouTube channels. I am compiling a list of approx 80 channels in the section below. I am sure this list will help many people to start and become experts in the fields of AI. From Statistics, Probability, Algebra, Calculus, Programming, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building to Deployment everything can be learned through these channels. This list is sorted in descending order of the number of videos available on these channels.</p><p>If you find any new channel which is not listed below, then please let me know. I will update this list.</p><p>Disclaimer: I am not associated with any of these channels. But based on my learning need, I have been using these channels and benefited hugely.</p><p><img src=https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dsresources/dsr107-ML-YouTubeChannels.jpg alt="ML YouTube Channels"></p><h2 id=data-scienceai-channels>Data Science/AI Channels<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#data-scienceai-channels aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>#</th><th>Title</th><th>Videos</th><th>Subscribers</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/MIT rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>MIT OpenCourseWare</a></td><td>6,345</td><td>2980.0K</td><td>Whether you’re a student, a teacher, or simply a curious person that wants to learn, MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) offers a wealth of insight and inspiration.

This course will focus on practical knowledge more than mathematical or theoretical rigor. That doesn’t mean that we would water down the content. We will try and balance the theory and practice while giving more preference to the practical and applied aspects of AI as the course name suggests. Through the course, we will work on 20+ case studies of real world AI problems and datasets to help students grasp the practical details of building AI solutions. For each idea/algorithm in AI, we would provide examples to provide the intuition and show how the idea to used in the real world.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY8mzqqGwl5_bTpBY9qLMAA rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Andreas Kretz</a></td><td>323</td><td>21.4K</td><td>I help you get into data engineering, the plumbing of data science.

Education. People who want to enter the field do not know where to start. They wonder whether they need a PhD, or perhaps a few years in a remotely related job. Universities have been slow at adapting their educational offering. In fact, a specialized data science training program is not even offered on most campuses, and when it is, the prerequisites of statistical and mathematical knowledge can be intimidating. All this results in an environment where companies struggle to find well-prepared candidates who have acquired the necessary expertise and are ready to start their data science career.

To do that, thousands of people have been working around the world and in space for more than 50 years, trying to answer some basic questions. What’s out there in space? How do we get there? What will we find? What can we learn there — or learn just by trying to get there — that will make life better here on Earth? NASA’s work is diverse: proving flight technologies; creating capabilities for sustainable human and robotic exploration; exploring Earth, the solar system and the universe beyond; developing critical enabling technologies such as the space shuttle; and conducting science in orbit aboard the International Space Station. With NASA you can explore the universe and discover Earth.</td></tr><tr><td>Science</td><td>11</td><td><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/Harvard rel="nofollow noopener" target=_blank>Harvard University</a></td><td>3,471</td><td>1580.0K</td><td>Harvard University’s YouTube channel shares video content about life and learning that takes place here on campus and around the world.
