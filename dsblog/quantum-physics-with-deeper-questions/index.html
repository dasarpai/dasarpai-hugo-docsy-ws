However, Quantum Physics, despite all my reading and learning, remains a mystery to me. At this stage, who can teach me Quantum Physics effectively? Finding an able professor, aligning my availability with theirs, and hoping they’d be willing to teach me for free seems impossible. So, I turned to a Large Language Model (LLM) for help. I could have explored other LLMs like Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, and many more. I’m not saying the others are bad, nor am I claiming that ChatGPT is the best at providing plausible answers. Whether an answer is correct or plausible also depends on the learner’s ability."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="dsblog"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-03-28T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-03-28T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Quantum Physics"><meta property="article:tag" content="Quantum Mechanics"><meta property="article:tag" content="Large Language Model"><meta property="article:tag" content="Artificial Intelligence"><meta property="article:tag" content="Machine Learning"><meta itemprop=name content="Quantum Physics with Deeper Questions with ChatGPT"><meta itemprop=description content="Quantum Physics with Deeper Questions with ChatGPT Introduction I was a physics student during my college years, and I’ve always loved the subject—even today.

However, Quantum Physics, despite all my reading and learning, remains a mystery to me. At this stage, who can teach me Quantum Physics effectively? Finding an able professor, aligning my availability with theirs, and hoping they’d be willing to teach me for free seems impossible. So, I turned to a Large Language Model (LLM) for help. I could have explored other LLMs like Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, and many more. I’m not saying the others are bad, nor am I claiming that ChatGPT is the best at providing plausible answers. Whether an answer is correct or plausible also depends on the learner’s ability.</p><p>This extensive session with ChatGPT has been a great learning experience for me. It has taught me so much about Quantum Physics, while simultaneously revealing how powerless LLMs can be when we don’t ask the right questions. We might criticize these LLMs as mere &ldquo;next-word predictors,&rdquo; but their power is undeniably immense. At the same time, I realize that without great teachers and researchers, we cannot advance science relying solely on LLMs. Yes, these models are more powerful than most humans in certain ways, but among humans, there are exceptional minds like Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Newton, Galileo, Ramanujan, and Aryabhata. It’s true that not all humans match their caliber, but we must recognize that creating such intellects requires a supportive society, systems, culture, and upbringing—conditions that allow such extraordinary individuals to emerge and challenge these AI systems. This challenge isn’t about discarding AI but about improving it and using it for the betterment of humanity.</p><h2 id=questions-i-asked>Questions I asked<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#questions-i-asked aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><ol><li>How come a quantum bit be 0 and 1 at the same time?</li><li>There is fault in &ldquo;coin in air&rdquo; analogy.</li><li>What are the foundations of quantum physics?</li><li>Why it is impossible to determine position and momentum at the same time?</li><li>Why do we say electron has wave particle duality?</li><li>What is the meaning that electron has wave nature?</li><li>Can you help me understanding wavefunction?</li><li>What path electron follow while traveling?</li><li>What is the meaning of electron is spread out during journey?</li><li>Does wavefunction keep changing during the travel?</li><li>How can a free electron with a constant energy moving through space?</li><li>How an electron can collide with atom?</li><li>Why electrons are negatively charged?</li><li>What is the smallest measurable charge?</li><li>What is coulomb and how to measure that?</li><li>There is a Gap in 1 Coulomb calculation value</li><li>How do we count that the number of electron is 6.242×10 ^18</li><li>How did we reach to this conclusion that 1ev or electron&rsquo;s charge is exactly this?</li><li>How much is 1 coulomb charge?</li><li>How to measure how many electron has moved?</li><li>If I want to measure number of electron moved in 10 watt bulb in 1 hour then how to do that?</li><li>How to measure 1 joule?</li><li>There is confusion in 1 joule calculation.</li><li>Conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics</li><li>How come massless gives rise to mass?</li><li>How can a photon achieve high energy?</li><li>How photon can have momentum when mass is zero?</li><li>What is the size of photon and electron that they collide and effect each other?</li><li>We don&rsquo;t know the size of a light particle of 500 nm wavelength!</li><li>When electron don&rsquo;t have definite size then how do we measure their mass?</li><li>Particles in Classical vs Quantum Physics.</li><li>What Does &ldquo;Finding&rdquo; an Electron Mean?</li><li>Water wave - Electron wave analogy is not correct.</li><li>The meaning of electron&rsquo;s wavefunction can exist in a superposition of states.</li><li>I can find a particular electron anywhere in the universe!</li><li>Can I go thousands of mile away and find that electron there?</li><li>What are different possible location of an electron?</li><li>A wavefunction is function of multiple functions, right?</li><li>How to construct a wavefunction?</li><li>Refine this wavefunction for 3D space.</li><li>With a given wavefunction, can we location particle at time t?</li><li>If I give you radius and wavefunction can you locate electron?</li><li>It is crazy, I need some expert now!</li></ol><h2 id=how-come-a-quantum-bit-be-0-and-1-at-the-same-time>How come a quantum bit be 0 and 1 at the same time?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#how-come-a-quantum-bit-be-0-and-1-at-the-same-time aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>When they say a quantum bit (qubit) can be &ldquo;zero and one at the same time,&rdquo; they are referring to <strong>superposition</strong>, which allows a qubit to exist in a combination of both states until it is measured. This is a unique feature of quantum systems, making quantum computing different from classical computing.</p><p><strong>Classical vs. Quantum Bits</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Classical bits</strong> (the ones in traditional computing) can be in one of two states at any time: either 0 or 1.</li><li><strong>Quantum bits (qubits)</strong>, on the other hand, can exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of both 0 and 1 states simultaneously, meaning that a qubit can be in a state that is a combination of both 0 and 1.</li></ul><p><strong>What is Superposition?</strong></p><ul><li>In classical computing, you would have a bit that is either in state 0 or state 1. But in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a <strong>quantum state</strong> that can be a <strong>linear combination</strong> (or superposition) of both states.</li></ul><p>For example, a qubit might be in a state that is 50% 0 and 50% 1, or any other combination. Mathematically, this is represented as:
$$$$\text{qubit state} = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle$$</p><p>where $$(\alpha)$$ and $$(\beta)$$ are complex numbers that define the probability amplitudes of measuring the qubit in state 0 or state 1.</p><p><strong>The Key Points:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Superposition</strong>: A qubit can be in a combination of both states at once, unlike classical bits that are always in one state.</li><li><strong>Measurement</strong>: When you measure a qubit, it &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; into one of the two possible states (0 or 1), with probabilities determined by the coefficients $$(\alpha)$$ and $$(\beta)$$. Before measurement, however, it truly exists in both states.</li><li><strong>Interference</strong>: This simultaneous existence of both states can lead to <strong>quantum interference</strong>, which is exploited in quantum computing algorithms to solve certain problems faster than classical computers.</li></ul><p><strong>Example:</strong>
Think of a coin spinning in the air. While it&rsquo;s spinning, it&rsquo;s not strictly heads or tails, but a mixture of both. Only when the coin lands (which is like measurement) do you know whether it’s heads or tails.</p><p>Similarly, a qubit can represent a state that is &ldquo;both 0 and 1&rdquo; until you measure it, at which point it will collapse into one of the two states, just like the coin lands on heads or tails.</p><h2 id=there-is-fault-in-coin-in-air-analogy>There is fault in &ldquo;coin in air&rdquo; analogy.<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#there-is-fault-in-coin-in-air-analogy aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>In your example of the coin at any point of time when coin is in the air by taking the photograph with a high frame rate camera we know whether coin is had a tail at that time so it is not correct to say that it is in both the position.</p><p>When you spin a coin, it is indeed in a specific state at any given moment—either heads or tails—though we may not know that state until we measure it by looking at it. A high-frame-rate camera could capture that exact moment and reveal whether the coin is closer to heads or tails, but the coin is never in both states simultaneously in the classical sense.</p><p>So, the coin example is not a perfect analogy for quantum superposition, as the coin only takes one state (heads or tails) at any moment, regardless of whether we observe it. It’s just that we don&rsquo;t know the state until we observe it.</p><p>Superposition is not about &ldquo;both states at once&rdquo; in a physical sense; it’s a deeper probabilistic reality unique to quantum systems.</p><h2 id=what-are-the-foundations-of-quantum-physics>What are the foundations of quantum physics?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-are-the-foundations-of-quantum-physics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The foundations of quantum physics reveal a universe that is fundamentally different from our everyday classical experiences. Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic realm with principles like superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty, enabling groundbreaking technologies while challenging our understanding of reality. The foundations of quantum physics are the fundamental principles, concepts, and theories that describe the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Quantum physics challenges the classical worldview, introducing concepts that are often counterintuitive. Here are the key foundations:</p><h3 id=1-wave-particle-duality><strong>1.

To understand this principle and the concept of momentum, let&rsquo;s break it down:</p><h3 id=what-is-momentum><strong>What is Momentum?</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-momentum aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Momentum</strong> $$( p )$$ is a measure of the motion of an object.

$$
p = mv
$$
where:</p><ul><li>$$( m )$$: mass of the object</li><li>$$( v )$$: velocity of the object</li></ul></li><li><p>Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning it has both <strong>magnitude</strong> (how fast it&rsquo;s moving) and <strong>direction</strong> (the direction of motion).</p></li></ul><p>In quantum mechanics, momentum is related to the wavelength of a particle&rsquo;s wave-like behavior:
$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$
where:</p><ul><li>$$( h )$$: Planck&rsquo;s constant $$(6.626 \times 10^{-34} , \text{Js})$$</li><li>$$( \lambda )$$: wavelength of the particle</li></ul><h3 id=heisenberg><strong>Heisenberg&rsquo;s Uncertainty Principle</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#heisenberg aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The uncertainty principle states:

Instead, it exhibits properties associated with <strong>waves</strong>, such as interference and diffraction, in addition to its particle-like behavior. This is a fundamental aspect of <strong>wave-particle duality</strong>, a concept in quantum mechanics. Electrons don’t &ldquo;wiggle&rdquo; or physically move like water waves, but they do exhibit behaviors associated with waves, such as interference and diffraction. This wave-like property describes the <strong>probabilities</strong> of where the electron might be, not its actual physical motion.</p><p>Let’s break this down:</p><h3 id=1-wave-properties-of-electrons><strong>1.

Let&rsquo;s break it down step by step:</p><h3 id=1-structure-of-a-conductor><strong>1. Structure of a Conductor</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#1-structure-of-a-conductor aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>While atoms are indeed mostly empty space, they still have a <strong>nucleus</strong> (made up of protons and neutrons) and <strong>electrons</strong> surrounding them in <strong>electron clouds</strong>. The electrons in a conductor, like copper or aluminum, are <strong>delocalized</strong>—meaning they are not tightly bound to a specific atom. These <strong>free electrons</strong> form what&rsquo;s called the <strong>electron sea</strong>, and they can move through the material (this is the electrical current).</p><p>Even though the atoms themselves are mostly empty space, the <strong>nucleus</strong> and the <strong>electron cloud</strong> still exert forces on the moving electrons.</p><h3 id=2-collisions-with-atoms><strong>2. Collisions with Atoms</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#2-collisions-with-atoms aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>When an electron moves through a conductor, it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s traveling through an empty vacuum. The electrons in the material constantly interact with the atomic nuclei and the other <strong>delocalized electrons</strong>. These interactions are primarily of two types:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Electron-Atom Collisions</strong>: The moving free electrons can collide with the positively charged atomic nuclei (or ions) in the material. While atoms are mostly empty space, the <strong>nucleus</strong> is dense and carries a positive charge, and the <strong>electron cloud</strong> can exert forces on the moving electrons as well.</p><ul><li>When the electron collides with these nuclei, it can <strong>lose some energy</strong> in the process. This is because the collision transfers some of the electron&rsquo;s energy to the atomic lattice (the structure of atoms in the material), causing the atoms to vibrate more (this is what we perceive as <strong>heat</strong>).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Electron-Electron Interactions</strong>: Electrons moving through the conductor can also interact with other <strong>free electrons</strong> in the material. These interactions can also cause the electron to scatter, losing some of its momentum and energy.</p></li></ul><h3 id=3-what-happens-during-the-collision><strong>3. What Happens During the Collision?</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#3-what-happens-during-the-collision aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>When the electron collides with an atom (or ion) in the conductor, it doesn&rsquo;t completely &ldquo;stop&rdquo; or lose all its energy. Instead, it loses some of its kinetic energy and <strong>changes direction</strong>. This process is <strong>scattering</strong>, and it’s a key reason why conductors have <strong>resistance</strong>.</p><p>The energy lost by the electron during a collision:</p><ul><li>Increases the <strong>vibration of atoms</strong> in the conductor (which corresponds to an increase in temperature).</li><li>Slows down the electron’s movement slightly (since it loses some energy).</li></ul><p>This resistance to the flow of electrons is what gives rise to the phenomenon we call <strong>electrical resistance</strong> in materials.</p><h3 id=4-why-doesnt-the-electron-go-straight-through><strong>4. Why Doesn’t the Electron Go Straight Through?</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#4-why-doesnt-the-electron-go-straight-through aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Even though the atom itself is mostly empty space, the <strong>electron cloud</strong> and <strong>nucleus</strong> interact with the moving electron. Electrons are negatively charged, and the <strong>positively charged nucleus</strong> can create a <strong>force field</strong> that repels or attracts the moving electron, causing it to scatter.</p><p>In quantum mechanics, electrons don’t travel in neat, straight lines; their positions and momenta are uncertain, and they behave like <strong>waves</strong>. The <strong>wave nature</strong> of the electron also means that when it encounters the atomic lattice, it is likely to be scattered in different directions, further slowing down the movement.</p><h3 id=5-effect-of-temperature-on-collisions><strong>5. Effect of Temperature on Collisions</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#5-effect-of-temperature-on-collisions aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The temperature of the conductor also plays a role. At higher temperatures, the <strong>atoms in the conductor vibrate more</strong> due to increased thermal energy, which leads to more frequent collisions between the free electrons and the atoms. This is why <strong>resistance</strong> increases with temperature: more collisions = more energy loss.</p><h3 id=6-a-simple-analogy><strong>6. A Simple Analogy</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#6-a-simple-analogy aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Imagine you&rsquo;re in a crowded room, walking through a group of people. While most of the room might be &ldquo;empty&rdquo; space, you still bump into people, and your movement gets slowed down. The more crowded the room (or the higher the temperature), the more often you bump into people, and the slower you move.</p><p>Similarly, an electron moving through a conductor is like a person moving through a crowded room of atoms. The more it &ldquo;bumps into&rdquo; the atoms, the more energy it loses, and the harder it is for the electron to move smoothly.</p><h3 id=summary-4><strong>Summary</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#summary-4 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Atoms</strong> in a conductor may be small, but they still <strong>exert forces</strong> on moving electrons due to their <strong>nucleus</strong> and <strong>electron cloud</strong>.</li><li>Electrons in conductors interact with these atoms through <strong>collisions</strong>, leading to energy loss in the form of heat.</li><li>This energy loss is what gives rise to <strong>electrical resistance</strong>, and it’s also why electrons don’t move in straight lines but instead get scattered and lose energy.</li></ul><h2 id=why-electrons-are-negatively-charged>Why electrons are negatively charged?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#why-electrons-are-negatively-charged aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You said &ldquo;Electrons are negatively charged,&rdquo; Why do you say it is negative charged, who not to say it is positive charged?

In this experiment, Millikan measured the <strong>force</strong> on tiny oil droplets suspended between two charged plates. Here&rsquo;s a brief overview of the experiment:</p><ul><li><strong>Millikan&rsquo;s Setup</strong>: He sprayed tiny droplets of oil between two parallel charged plates. He adjusted the electric field between the plates to suspend individual droplets in mid-air (in equilibrium), balancing the force due to gravity with the force due to the electric field.</li><li><strong>The Key Idea</strong>: The oil droplets were negatively charged (due to friction), and by adjusting the electric field, Millikan could precisely determine the <strong>charge on individual droplets</strong>.</li><li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: By carefully measuring the <strong>velocity</strong> of oil droplets in different positions and the strength of the applied electric field, he was able to determine the <strong>discrete charges</strong> on the droplets.</li></ul><h4 id=2-key-finding>2. <strong>Key Finding:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#2-key-finding aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4><ul><li>Millikan observed that the <strong>charges on the droplets</strong> were always <strong>multiples of a smallest unit</strong>. This unit was consistent across many trials, and it turned out to be the <strong>charge of a single electron</strong>.</li><li>From this experiment, Millikan deduced that the charge of a single electron is approximately $$( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} , \text{C} )$$.</li></ul><h4 id=3-why-millikans-experiment-worked>3. <strong>Why Millikan’s Experiment Worked:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#3-why-millikans-experiment-worked aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4><ul><li>Millikan used very precise equipment and methods to suspend and measure the droplets.

The equivalent energy values are determined through <strong>experiments</strong> and <strong>mathematical relationships</strong> (e.g., specific heat for heating, voltage and current for electrical work, force and distance for mechanical work). This is why 1 joule of energy is the same, whether it’s applied as mechanical work, electrical energy, or heat.</p><h2 id=conservation-of-energy-is-a-fundamental-principle-in-physics>Conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#conservation-of-energy-is-a-fundamental-principle-in-physics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You said &ldquo;The conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics that states energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.&rdquo; But when we destroy the matter then energy can be created. And we condense energy we can create matter, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Yes, you&rsquo;re absolutely right! You&rsquo;ve touched upon some fascinating and deep concepts from modern physics. Let&rsquo;s break down the ideas you&rsquo;re raising:</p><h3 id=1-conservation-of-energy-and-matter><strong>1. Conservation of Energy and Matter</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#1-conservation-of-energy-and-matter aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The <strong>law of conservation of energy</strong> states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. However, this principle holds within the <strong>known systems</strong> and <strong>classical physics</strong>. It applies well to most everyday situations.</p><p>However, <strong>Einstein’s theory of relativity</strong> (specifically the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>) tells us that energy and matter are <strong>interchangeable</strong>. This is a revolutionary concept that goes beyond the classical understanding of energy conservation.</p><h3 id=2-matter-and-energy-equivalence-e--mc><strong>2. Matter and Energy Equivalence (E = mc²)</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#2-matter-and-energy-equivalence-e--mc aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>In the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>, <strong>E</strong> represents energy, <strong>m</strong> represents mass, and <strong>c</strong> represents the speed of light. This shows that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Essentially, <strong>mass can be converted into energy</strong>, and <strong>energy can be converted into mass</strong>.</p><h4 id=examples-of-energy-matter-interconversion><strong>Examples of Energy-Matter Interconversion:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#examples-of-energy-matter-interconversion aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4><ul><li><p><strong>When matter is destroyed (like in particle-antiparticle annihilation)</strong>, the mass of the particles is converted into <strong>pure energy</strong> in the form of <strong>gamma rays</strong> (high-energy photons). This is a real-world example of energy being &ldquo;created&rdquo; from matter, as the mass of the matter is transformed into energy.</p></li><li><p><strong>When energy condenses into matter</strong>, this is typically seen in high-energy processes like <strong>pair production</strong>. For example, when high-energy photons (gamma rays) interact with a strong electromagnetic field, they can produce a particle-antiparticle pair (such as an electron and a positron). This is how energy can be converted into matter, as the energy of the photons becomes the mass of the particles.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, while <strong>energy</strong> cannot simply &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; or be &ldquo;created from nothing,&rdquo; <strong>matter can indeed be converted to energy</strong> and vice versa. This transformation process is fundamental to understanding the <strong>universe</strong> at both <strong>cosmological scales</strong> (like stars, supernovae, and black holes) and <strong>microscopic scales</strong> (like particle collisions).</p><h3 id=3><strong>3. &ldquo;Destroying Matter&rdquo; and Creating Energy</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#3 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>When matter is destroyed or converted, as in <strong>nuclear reactions</strong> (fission or fusion), the energy released is far greater than what you would expect from chemical reactions. This is because the mass of the matter is not entirely destroyed; part of it is converted into energy, as explained by <strong>E = mc²</strong>.</p><p>For instance, in the <strong>sun</strong>, hydrogen atoms undergo <strong>fusion</strong> to form helium, and in the process, a small amount of mass is lost and converted into energy (in the form of light and heat). This is a direct example of <strong>energy being released by converting mass</strong> into energy.</p><h3 id=4><strong>4. &ldquo;Condensing Energy to Create Matter&rdquo;</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#4 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Yes, in the right conditions, energy can <strong>condense</strong> into matter. One of the most famous instances of this is the <strong>Big Bang</strong>, where immense amounts of energy condensed to form the matter of the universe. More commonly, <strong>pair production</strong> is a quantum process where energy (such as high-energy photons) converts into a particle-antiparticle pair.</p><h4 id=how-it-works><strong>How it Works:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#how-it-works aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4><ul><li><p>In <strong>pair production</strong>, a photon with enough energy (greater than 1.022 MeV, the combined mass-energy of an electron and a positron) can transform into an electron and a positron (which is the antimatter counterpart of the electron). The photon’s energy is effectively <strong>converted into mass</strong> in the form of two particles.</p></li><li><p>This process occurs only under certain conditions (such as in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field), because the energy needs to be <strong>sufficient</strong> to create the rest mass of the particles.</p></li></ul><h3 id=5-the-role-of-energy-in-creating-matter><strong>5. The Role of Energy in Creating Matter:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#5-the-role-of-energy-in-creating-matter aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>In <strong>high-energy physics</strong> (like in particle accelerators), scientists can create new particles by <strong>colliding high-energy particles</strong> (such as protons) together. The energy of the collision is sometimes enough to create new particles, showing that energy can indeed be converted into matter.</p><p>For example, when two protons collide at very high speeds in a particle accelerator (like the <strong>Large Hadron Collider</strong>), the kinetic energy of the protons can convert into various new particles (like <strong>Higgs bosons</strong> or other exotic particles). This shows that <strong>energy is not only conserved but can create new matter</strong> under the right conditions.</p><h3 id=summary-of-key-concepts><strong>Summary of Key Concepts:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#summary-of-key-concepts aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Energy conservation</strong> holds true in classical physics, where energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted.</li><li><strong>Matter and energy are interchangeable</strong>—as expressed by <strong>E = mc²</strong>—and under certain conditions, energy can be converted into matter and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Destruction of matter</strong> (such as in particle-antiparticle annihilation) <strong>creates energy</strong>, while <strong>energy condensing into matter</strong> happens in processes like pair production or particle collisions.</li></ul><h2 id=how-come-massless-gives-rise-to-mass>How come massless gives rise to mass?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#how-come-massless-gives-rise-to-mass aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You said &ldquo;This is how energy can be converted into matter, as the energy of the photons becomes the mass of the particles.&rdquo;<br>It means massless photon give rise to a mass particle.</p><p>Yes, that&rsquo;s correct! The key idea here is that <strong>photons</strong>, which are massless particles, can indeed give rise to <strong>massive particles</strong> under certain conditions. This is a fascinating concept in <strong>quantum field theory</strong> and <strong>high-energy physics</strong>, where energy and mass are intimately connected.</p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><h3 id=photon-and-pair-production><strong>Photon and Pair Production:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#photon-and-pair-production aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>A photon, despite being massless, carries <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>momentum</strong>.

For example, it can create an <strong>electron</strong> and a <strong>positron</strong>, which are massive particles.</p><p>The key to understanding this is that the <strong>energy of the photon</strong> (E) gets converted into <strong>mass</strong> (m) of the particles. This conversion follows the equation <strong>E = mc²</strong>, where the energy of the photon is transformed into the rest mass of the newly created particles.</p><h4 id=example-3>Example:<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#example-3 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h4><ul><li>A photon with enough energy (greater than 1.022 MeV, the combined rest mass energy of an electron and a positron) can produce an <strong>electron</strong> and a <strong>positron</strong> (which is the antimatter counterpart of the electron).

The energy of the photon is being converted into mass during pair production. Essentially, <strong>the photon’s energy &ldquo;creates&rdquo; mass</strong> when it’s able to produce a particle-antiparticle pair.</p><p>It’s important to note that this process <strong>requires</strong> certain conditions, such as:</p><ul><li>The <strong>photon must have high enough energy</strong> (at least 1.022 MeV).</li><li>The process typically happens in the presence of <strong>a strong electromagnetic field</strong>, like that near a nucleus, because it helps conserve momentum during the interaction.</li></ul><h3 id=why-doesn><strong>Why Doesn&rsquo;t This Contradict the Idea of Massless Photons?</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#why-doesn aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Photons are indeed <strong>massless</strong> in the sense that they have <strong>no rest mass</strong>. However, they still carry <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>momentum</strong>, and energy and momentum are related to mass through Einstein&rsquo;s famous equation $$( E = mc^2 )$$. When a photon interacts with a field, its energy can manifest as mass in the form of particles. This doesn’t contradict the fact that photons are massless; instead, it demonstrates how <strong>energy can create matter</strong>.</p><h3 id=key-takeaway><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#key-takeaway aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>So, even though photons are massless, their <strong>energy</strong> can lead to the creation of <strong>massive particles</strong> under the right conditions.

For an electron, the Compton wavelength is given by:</li></ul><p>$$

When we talk about a <strong>photon</strong> (a light particle), we don&rsquo;t define its size in the way we do for macroscopic objects or even other particles like electrons. Instead, the <strong>photon</strong> is described by its <strong>wave properties</strong>, particularly its <strong>wavelength</strong> and <strong>frequency</strong>, which are related to its energy.</p><h3 id=why-dont-we-define-a-photons-size-in-traditional-terms>Why don&rsquo;t we define a photon’s size in traditional terms?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#why-dont-we-define-a-photons-size-in-traditional-terms aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>Photons are Quantum Objects:</strong>
A photon is a quantum of electromagnetic radiation. It doesn&rsquo;t have a physical size like a classical object because it doesn&rsquo;t have a spatially extended structure. It is described by its <strong>wavefunction</strong>, which gives the probability of where the photon is likely to be found.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wave-Particle Duality:</strong>
The <strong>photon</strong> behaves both as a particle (with energy and momentum) and as a wave (with wavelength and frequency). The wave nature means that instead of thinking of it as a particle with a physical size, we consider it in terms of its <strong>wavelength</strong>. For example, a photon with a wavelength of 500 nm (nanometers) is in the visible light spectrum and has certain properties that describe its energy and momentum. The wavelength of the photon is related to the <strong>spatial extent of its wave-like behavior</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Photon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Size&rdquo; as Wavelength:</strong>
In some ways, you can think of the wavelength as a &ldquo;spatial&rdquo; characteristic. For a photon with a wavelength of <strong>500 nm</strong>, this is the spatial extent over which its wave oscillates. However, this does not mean the photon has a &ldquo;size&rdquo; like a ball or a particle. It simply means that the <strong>probability of the photon being found</strong> in a specific place follows a wave distribution that can be described by its wavelength.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uncertainty Principle:</strong>
The <strong>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</strong> tells us that for quantum objects like photons, we can&rsquo;t precisely know both their <strong>position</strong> and <strong>momentum</strong> at the same time. This is another reason why we don’t think about photons in terms of fixed, localized sizes. Instead, they are described by their <strong>wavefunction</strong>, which gives the probability of detecting the photon in different regions of space.</p></li></ol><h3 id=the-wavelength-and-size>The Wavelength and Size<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-wavelength-and-size aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>For a photon with a wavelength of <strong>500 nm</strong> (which is in the visible light range), the <strong>wavelength</strong> refers to the distance between two consecutive crests of the electromagnetic wave. This gives us an idea of the <strong>spatial extent</strong> of the photon’s wave-like behavior, but not its &ldquo;size&rdquo; in a classical sense.</p><p>In summary, we don&rsquo;t define a <strong>photon’s size</strong> in traditional terms because it doesn&rsquo;t have a well-defined spatial extent like classical objects. Instead, its properties are described by its wavelength (like 500 nm for visible light), energy, and momentum. These properties determine how the photon interacts with matter and how its behavior is observed.</p><h2 id=when-electron-dont-have-definite-size-then-how-do-we-measure-their-mass>When electron don&rsquo;t have definite size then how do we measure their mass?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#when-electron-dont-have-definite-size-then-how-do-we-measure-their-mass aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>You said &ldquo;electrons don&rsquo;t have a definite size or shape like macroscopic objects.&rdquo; then how do we measure the mass of this?

This mass is one of the fundamental properties of the electron, and it is not related to the electron&rsquo;s &ldquo;size&rdquo; in a physical sense but is an intrinsic property.</p></li><li><p>The <strong>weight</strong> of an electron depends on the gravitational field it is in, just like any other object. However, because the mass is so small, the weight of an electron in Earth&rsquo;s gravitational field is minuscule and difficult to measure directly.</p></li></ul><p>To understand the mass or weight of an electron, scientists often use techniques that involve measuring its behavior under various forces. For example, in a <strong>cathode ray tube</strong> or in experiments like the <strong>Millikan oil-drop experiment</strong>, the electron’s charge and its behavior in electric or magnetic fields were used to deduce its mass.</p><p>Even though electrons don&rsquo;t have a traditional size, we still measure their <strong>mass</strong> and <strong>charge</strong> as fundamental quantities.</p><h3 id=2-probability-of-finding-an-electron>2. <strong>Probability of Finding an Electron:</strong><a class=td-heading-self-link href=#2-probability-of-finding-an-electron aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>When we talk about the <strong>&ldquo;probability of finding an electron&rdquo;</strong>, we are referring to the concept of the <strong>electron&rsquo;s wavefunction</strong> in <strong>quantum mechanics</strong>.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wavefunction (ψ):</strong> In quantum mechanics, the behavior of an electron is described by a <strong>wavefunction</strong>, which encodes all the information about the electron&rsquo;s state, such as its position, energy, and momentum.</p></li><li><p>The wavefunction is a <strong>mathematical function</strong> that gives us the probability distribution of where an electron might be found in a given space.

Similarly, the water wave is described by a wave equation that governs the motion of water molecules.</p><p>However, the key difference is that the electron&rsquo;s wavefunction describes <strong>probability distributions</strong> of its position, while a classical wave (like the water wave) describes the <strong>movement of material</strong> through space.

Suppose I have 1 cubic meter box and electron starts from a corner from a electronic gun then what is the location of electron after 1 ns?</p><p>This is an insightful question that gets to the heart of the nature of quantum particles like electrons and photons. The key issue is that, in quantum mechanics, we <strong>cannot precisely describe</strong> the electron&rsquo;s position at any given moment in time, until we make a measurement. This is where the concept of the <strong>wavefunction</strong> comes in, which helps us understand the probabilistic nature of quantum objects.</p><h3 id=understanding-the-movement-of-an-electron-in-3d-space>Understanding the Movement of an Electron in 3D Space:<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#understanding-the-movement-of-an-electron-in-3d-space aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>To break it down step by step:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Wavefunction and Probability</strong>:</p><ul><li>The <strong>wavefunction</strong> is a mathematical representation of the possible locations of an electron in space, not a description of its exact position. The <strong>probability distribution</strong> (which comes from the wavefunction) tells us where we are likely to find the electron when we measure it. This means that, before measuring, the electron is <strong>not at a single point</strong>. Instead, it exists in a state of <strong>probability</strong>, spread out over a region of space.</li><li>If you imagine an electron in a cubic meter box, and the electron starts at one corner (let’s assume this is at time <code>t = 0</code>), the wavefunction at <code>t = 1 ns</code> will describe a <strong>probability distribution</strong> that indicates how likely the electron is to be found at different positions within the box at that moment.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>How does the Electron &ldquo;Travel&rdquo;?</strong>:</p><ul><li>According to quantum mechanics, <strong>before measurement</strong>, we cannot think of the electron as traveling along a definite path like a classical object. Instead, it exists as a &ldquo;probability cloud.&rdquo; Its wavefunction spreads out over time, meaning the electron has a probability of being found in various locations in space, but we cannot say with certainty where it is.</li><li><strong>If we did measure its position</strong> at <code>t = 1 ns</code>, the electron would <strong>collapse</strong> to a specific point in the box. The measurement forces the system to &ldquo;choose&rdquo; a specific location. But <strong>before the measurement</strong>, we only have probabilities. The wavefunction will give us a range of possible positions for the electron, but it won&rsquo;t tell us its precise location.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>What Happens After 1 ns?</strong>:</p><ul><li>If the electron is in free space (not interacting with anything), its wavefunction will evolve according to the <strong>Schrödinger equation</strong>. The wavefunction will spread out, meaning the electron has a <strong>greater probability</strong> of being found at different places in the box after 1 ns. It could be closer to the other end of the box, or it could still be near the starting point. We cannot know exactly where it is, only the probabilities of where it could be found when we measure.</li><li>The <strong>spread</strong> of the wavefunction will depend on the <strong>momentum</strong> and <strong>energy</strong> of the electron. If the electron has a high momentum (fast speed), its wavefunction will spread out less over time, and the electron is more likely to be found closer to its initial position. If the electron has low momentum (moves slowly), its wavefunction will spread out more, and it could be found anywhere in the box.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The Concept of &ldquo;Path&rdquo; and Measurement</strong>:</p><ul><li>Unlike classical particles (like a baseball or a car), which follow <strong>definite paths</strong> through space, quantum particles like electrons do not have a clear, definite path until they are measured. They exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of all possible paths.</li><li>When you measure the electron&rsquo;s position, the superposition collapses, and you get a specific location. This process is known as <strong>wavefunction collapse</strong>. But <strong>before the measurement</strong>, the electron doesn&rsquo;t have a definite location—it only has a <strong>probability of being in different places</strong>.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=example-in-a-1-cubic-meter-box>Example in a 1 Cubic Meter Box:<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#example-in-a-1-cubic-meter-box aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>Let’s say an electron is emitted from a corner of a 1 cubic meter box, and we want to know where it might be after 1 ns. Here&rsquo;s how we would think about it:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1: Initial Wavefunction</strong>: When the electron is emitted, it has a wavefunction that might be sharply concentrated at the corner (the initial location), but over time, this wavefunction spreads out. The more time that passes, the more the wavefunction spreads.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2: Probability Distribution at 1 ns</strong>: After 1 ns, the wavefunction describes the <strong>probability</strong> of finding the electron at any given point in the box. The electron could be anywhere, but we would have a higher probability of finding it near the starting point if it is moving slowly. If it&rsquo;s moving faster, the wavefunction might spread out more evenly across the box.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3: Collapse upon Measurement</strong>: If you measure the electron&rsquo;s position at <code>t = 1 ns</code>, the wavefunction collapses, and the electron will be found at a specific point in the box. The position is random but governed by the probability distribution. So, if the wavefunction indicates a higher probability of the electron being near one side of the box, it’s more likely to be found there, but there is always some chance of finding it in other places.</p></li></ul><h3 id=why-cant-we-know-the-exact-location-of-the-electron>Why Can&rsquo;t We Know the Exact Location of the Electron?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#why-cant-we-know-the-exact-location-of-the-electron aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><p>The electron doesn’t have a &ldquo;definite&rdquo; position unless we measure it. This is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and is a direct result of <strong>Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle</strong>. According to this principle, we cannot simultaneously know both the <strong>exact position</strong> and <strong>exact momentum</strong> of a particle like an electron. The more precisely we try to measure one, the less precisely we can know the other.</p><p>In your scenario:</p><ul><li>If we try to track the <strong>exact position</strong> of the electron after 1 ns, the uncertainty in its momentum (and therefore its velocity) will increase. This means the electron’s position is probabilistic, and we can only know the likelihood of finding it in a certain region.</li></ul><h3 id=key-takeaways>Key Takeaways:<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#key-takeaways aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h3><ol><li>The electron <strong>does not travel in a definite path</strong> like a classical object.

Before you measure the electron&rsquo;s position, its state is described by a <strong>wavefunction</strong>, which represents a superposition of all possible locations the electron could occupy within the box. This wavefunction gives the <strong>probability</strong> of finding the electron at any given point in the box.</p></li><li><p><strong>Measurement and Wavefunction Collapse</strong>:
When you measure the electron&rsquo;s position, the act of measurement causes the wavefunction to &ldquo;collapse.&rdquo; This means that the electron will be detected at a specific location, and this location is chosen according to the <strong>probability distribution</strong> given by the wavefunction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low-Probability Locations</strong>:
If the probability of finding the electron at the top of the box is low (but not zero), there is still a chance the measurement could &ldquo;find&rdquo; the electron there.
