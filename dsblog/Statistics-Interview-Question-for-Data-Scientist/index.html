I firmly believe if examples are clear, then a human mind is smart enough in generalizing, creating theories and definitions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The purpose of this blog is not to give you clear-cut definitions of important concepts of statistics but help you in visualizing the ideas in your mind. So that even without the definitions you understand what a particular idea means.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This blog is written keeping learners from software engineering background in mind. They have a lot of confusion around the naming convention used in statistics like event, experiments, variable, test, sample, significance, confidence level, theoretical probability, statistical measure and their calculation, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To give an example, in most of the places, I will use the “job_applicant” dataset. This dataset has data about the people who applied for a job in the company and applicants were either selected or rejected by the company. So the information in this dataset is the applicant&rsquo;s name, date of birth, date of application, job applied, last salary, education, living_city, selected, etc.</p></blockquote><h1 id=about-statistics>About Statistics<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#about-statistics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=can-you-tell-me-about-population-space-or-sample-space>Can you tell me about population space or sample space?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#can-you-tell-me-about-population-space-or-sample-space aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Population space where all the observation are stored. Sample space is where some of the observation are stored. If your organization has 300K employees then the population space of all the employees of your organization is 300K. If you create a sample of 100 employees from this sample space then 100 employee are forming a sample space. Sample space is creating in sampling process. Every sampling has some purpose, therefore it must ensure that sample represents the population. There are many techniques to ensure this.</p><p>If there are 5 variables like Name, Age, Gender, Title, Salary then no two observations in the population or sample dataset can have the same information. Possible outcome of 2 observations in sample or population space can be &ldquo;John Smith&rdquo;, who is 35 years old, male, has a job title of &ldquo;Manager&rdquo;, and earns a salary of $ 70,000. Another possible outcome could be the employee named &ldquo;Jane Doe&rdquo;, who is 42 years old, female, has a job title of &ldquo;Engineer&rdquo;, and earns a salary of $80,000.</p><p>A sample space, often denoted by the symbol S, is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. The population space, often denoted by the symbol Ω, is the set of all possible outcomes of a random process. The population space is typically not known and it is the sample space that we use to make inferences about the population.</p><h2 id=what-is-random-process-random-experiment-random-event-all-are-the-same-thing-or-different>What is Random Process, Random Experiment, Random Event, all are the same thing or different?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-random-process-random-experiment-random-event-all-are-the-same-thing-or-different aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>A random process is a sequence of events that cannot be predicted exactly. For example, tomorrow&rsquo;s stock price of X stock. It depends on many dozens of variables.</p><p>A random experiment is an experiment in which the outcome is uncertain and can take on different values based on chance or probability. Traffic movement, dice throw, selecting employee, coin throw.</p><p>A random event is a specific outcome of a random process. Coming head in tossing random process, coming 4 in dice throw random process, selecting Ph.D holder from employee dataset, a vehicle can turn right on a traffic light.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-variable-and-random-variable>What is the difference between variable and random variable?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-difference-between-variable-and-random-variable aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>An observation has attribute, for example an employee # 108 is one observation from our sample of population dataset.

It is a metric. For example mean, median, and mode are measures to know the central tendency of data. In our example dataset we can summarize the age column, as &ldquo;mean age&rdquo;=35 years, or median age is 38 years.</li><li>A tool is a physical object or software or app used <strong>to accomplish a task</strong>. For example, Microsoft Project for creating a project schedule and identifying a critical path.</li><li>A technique is a <strong>method or procedure used to accomplish a task</strong>. It is related to a simple problem. For example, a technique used to open the lid of an air-tight box or visualize 4 dimensional data on a 2D plane.</li><li>A method is a <strong>systematic approach</strong> to solve a problem.

A sample is a representation of the population. The goal of sampling is to select a group of individuals from a population that will be representative of the population as a whole. A sample is used to make inferences about the population from which it was drawn. A sample is used for estimating population parameters, such as the mean or standard deviation, and to test hypotheses about the population.</p><p>An observation, on the other hand, <strong>refers to a single measurement or data point</strong>. Observations are the individual pieces of data collected in a study. A sample can contain multiple observations, for example, a sample of 100 people means 100 different observations of different individuals, each observation can have multiple data points such as age, gender, income, etc.</p><p>In summary, a sample is a subset of a population, which is chosen to represent the population, while an observation is a single data point or measurement collected from an individual within the sample. A sample is used to make inferences about the population, whereas observations are used to make inferences about the sample.</p><p><img src=../../assets/images/dspost/statistics/observation-sample-population.png alt="observation sample population"></p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-census>What is the difference between statistics and census?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-census aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

To establish the relationship just observation of existing data is enough.</p><p>Experimental Data: If you <strong>change the number of working hours</strong> then what is the impact of this on <strong>number of defects produced</strong>? This way, you experiment with different working hours, sometimes you increase the hours, and at other times you decrease the hours. This collected data is experimental data. Before collecting the data I have an intention to experiment. In one experiment, we increased the number of working hours and then noted the number of defects. In another experiment, we decreased the number of working hours and then noted the number of defects.

This is done by analyzing data sets and using mathematical models to uncover patterns and correlations that can be used to forecast potential results and trends. Predictive Statistics can be used in many different areas such as marketing, business forecasting, machine learning, and health care. Machine learning models are built for predictive statistics.</p><h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-of-descriptive-statistics>What are statistical measures of Descriptive Statistics?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-are-statistical-measures-of-descriptive-statistics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Descriptive statistics measures include mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles, skewness, kurtosis, and covariance. In statistics, we can study, and analyze these measures for sample data or for population data. In fact, when it is not possible to do a census then we use these measures of sample data and predict/extrapolate/postulate about the population measure. For example, if you want to know the average life expectancy of Indian women then you collect sample data and using that you can postulate about the average age of the entire indian women population. There is a process for doing this. In this process, there can be errors and there are processes of handling/factoring that error component.</p><h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-in-inferential-statistics>What are statistical measures in Inferential Statistics?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-are-statistical-measures-in-inferential-statistics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Inferential statistics measures include z-score, t-test, chi-square test, correlation coefficient, confidence interval, and p-value.</p><h2 id=what-are-statistical-measures-in-predictive-statistics>What are statistical measures in Predictive Statistics?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-are-statistical-measures-in-predictive-statistics aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>To measure the performance of statistical models we have several measures.

Further, there are two types of categorical variables. Applicant_education can be Higher_Secondry, Graduate, Master, Ph.D. But this random variable has an order from low to high therefore it is called an ordinal categorical variable or <strong>ordinal variable</strong>. Applicant_city or color of the side of the die does not have any order therefore they are called nominal categorical variables or <strong>nominal variables.</strong></p><p>In the employee dataset, what can be the value of applicant_age or salary?

It may be house-price, cost-of-project, time-to-complete-project, salary-of-new-hired, promotion of employee, churn-of-a-customer etc. These are called dependent variables. But to predict these we need the help of some other variables, on which the value of these dependent variables depends. Like house-price can be predicted from the area of a house, the cost-of-project can be predicted from the cost of the materials used, etc. These predictors are called independent variables. If there is only one predictor then we need simple linear regression. But in real business or personal life, you need more than one predictor, in that situation multi-linear regression is needed to predict.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-regression-coefficient-and-correlation-coefficient>What is the difference between the regression coefficient and correlation coefficient?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-difference-between-the-regression-coefficient-and-correlation-coefficient aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>The regression coefficient is used to quantify the relationship between two variables. It can tell you keep all variables constant if you change a variable (related to regression coefficient) by 1 unit then how much change will happen on the target variable. The regression coefficient takes into account the slopes and intercepts of the line of best fit that is created when plotting the data points. The regression coefficient also allows for a more accurate prediction of outcome values based on input values.</p><p>While the correlation coefficient measures the direction and strength of the linear relationship between two variables.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-statistical-model>What is a statistical model?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-a-statistical-model aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>A statistical model is a mathematical representation of a real-world phenomenon. It is used to make predictions and analyze data. The data generated by the model and real-world data will have some differences and this is called an error in the model. For example, based on certain parameters like carpet_area, number_of_bedroom, etc. a model can predict house price should be 1.2 crores, but the actual price is 1 core. Thus, the model is predicting the price as 20 lakhs Rupees more. This is a model error. Keeping people&rsquo;s behavior, market opportunities, etc in mind we can never make a statistical model with zero error. But if I could guess the distribution of input variables correctly then the output of our model will have fewer errors.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-statistical-model-and-mathematical-model>What is the difference between Statistical Model and Mathematical Model?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-difference-between-statistical-model-and-mathematical-model aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Mathematical models are deterministic, the input is clearly known, the outcome is fixed. Newton&rsquo;s equation of motion is a Mathematical Model. It represents the physical reality of the world. In $$s = u*t + \frac{1}{2}<em>a</em>t^2$$ You provide the value of u,t, and a and you will get accurate s.</p><p>Statistical models are non-deterministic or stochastic, some of the inputs are probabilistic, and the outcome is also probabilistic. When you develop a model to predict a house price then you need a statistical model. In your model parameters may be carpet_area, number of bedrooms, etc. From the sample data, we know if the area is 2000sft then the price can be 1cr, it can be 1.2cr, or 1.5cr. For the same carpet area the price is different. It is not only because of other parameters but because of market opportunities. Thus input and output of the model will be probabilistic. Because of this non-deterministic nature, we need to assume the distribution of the data, so that outcome is more certain.</p><h1 id=about-tools--techniques>About Tools & Techniques<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#about-tools--techniques aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><h2 id=what-is-regression>What is regression?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-regression aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>If you want to predict salary from experience or the “number of projects done” then you can use regression analysis.</p><p>A generic linear regression equation is $$y=mx+c$$. Where y is a dependent variable like salary (which you want to predict), x is an independent variable like no_of_years_experience. m is the slope of the line or coefficient. c is an intercept of the line, which will give you the value of salary even if the experience is zero.

Positive correlation means they move in the same direction, when one increases the other also increases and vice versa. When two variables are numeric you can use Pearson correlation.</p><p>The formula for Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient, denoted by &ldquo;r,&rdquo; is:</p><p>$$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$</p><p>you can also write it like</p><p>$$r = \frac{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n} }</p><p>{\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}</p><p>\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$</p><p>or</p><p>$$ \rho_{(x,y)} = \frac { Cov(x, y)} {(Std(x) * Std(y)) }$$</p><p>where x and y are the two numeric variables being correlated, n is the number of observations, and $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the means of the x and y variables, respectively.</p><h2 id=how-many-types-of-correlation-coefficient-are-there-in-stats>How many types of correlation coefficient are there in stats?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#how-many-types-of-correlation-coefficient-are-there-in-stats aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>There are several types of correlation coefficients that are commonly used in statistics to measure the <strong>strength</strong> and <strong>direction of a linear relationship</strong> between two variables. Here are a few of the most common ones:</p><ol><li><p>Pearson correlation coefficient: The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a strong negative relationship, 0 indicates no relationship, and 1 indicates a strong positive relationship. For example: relationship between experience and salary.</p></li><li><p>Spearman rank correlation coefficient: The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between two categorical variables. It is calculated based on the ranks of the values rather than the raw data. For example: relationship between gender and bone cancer.</p></li><li><p>Kendall rank correlation coefficient: The Kendall rank correlation coefficient is another nonparametric measure of the strength of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is calculated based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs in the data.</p></li><li><p>Partial correlation coefficient: The partial correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between two variables, taking into account the influence of one or more additional variables.</p></li><li><p>Intraclass correlation coefficient: The intraclass correlation coefficient is a measure of the degree of agreement between observations that are made on the same subjects. It is commonly used in the analysis of repeated measures data.</p></li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate correlation coefficient based on the nature of the data and the type of relationship you are interested in.</p><h2 id=what-is-autocorrelation>What is AutoCorrelation?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-autocorrelation aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Let’s say we have share price data of a company. These observations are monthly. We want to know if there is any pattern in this monthly data? For that purpose we try the relationship between the stock price. But this time the original stock price is associated with “after month share price”. This shifting is called one month lagging, it means 1949-01 data is compared with 1949-02 data, and so on. Similarly you can shift data 2 time periods or 3 time periods. When you check the relationship between original share price and 1 lagged shared price or 2 lagged shared price or 3 lagged share price it gives you a correlation coefficient.

Let&rsquo;s say our salary column minimum value 20,000, maximum value 150,000 and mean value 50,000. If this column is normally distributed then 50% of the people will have a salary &lt;=50,000 and 50% of the people will have a salary >50,000. When you convert this column into z-scale you need to calculate the z-score of every value. In that situation the z-value of the mean will become 0, and less than mean values will become negative z-values and more than mean values will become positive z-values. After this scaling you can say 99% of the data is within -3 to +3 Z scale. You can pick-up any other column, like age, which is a completely different scale compared to salary. When you convert that into z-scale then 99% of the age will be within -3 to +3 z scale. For calculating z score we can use the formula $$\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$. This is called standard scaling of salary column values.</p><p>Thus a z-score is a description of how far a sample or point of data is away from its mean. Z score value can be negative or positive. Larger the absolute z score value of any point, far away that is from the mean. For example, if we want to calculate the z-score of a salary 30,000 then the Z score of 30,000 = (30,000 - 50,000) /10,000 = -2. It means a 30,000 salary is 2 distance away from the mean, but left side.</p><p>If we want to convert a salary of 70,000 into sigma value we get z score = (70,000-50,000)/10,000 = 2. It means a 70,000 salary is also 2 distance away from the mean but right side.</p><p>During a statistical test we need to make sure that z score of any given value should not fall in the critical range, otherwise the null hypothesis will be rejected. We will discuss this in detail at another place.</p><p><strong>Because of its utility and applications, In statistics and process control perhaps Sigma or SD or Standard Deviation is the most popular measure.</strong></p><p><strong>Sigma of Statistics, Sigma of process control and Z score are confusing and sometimes used interchangeably.</strong></p><h2 id=what-is-the-sigma-value-in-statistics-normal-distribution>What is the Sigma value in Statistics (Normal Distribution)?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-sigma-value-in-statistics-normal-distribution aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>It helps us in understanding the distribution of sample data.

Imagine you are studying the heights of adult males in a certain population. The population mean height is 170 cm and the population standard deviation is 10 cm. If you take a sample of 5 adult males, you would calculate the sample mean height. Each time you take a different sample of 5 adult males, you would get a different sample mean height.</p><p>Now, imagine taking many samples of 5 adult males, each time calculating the &ldquo;sample mean height&rdquo;. The distribution of the &ldquo;sample mean heights&rdquo; is known as the &ldquo;sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo;. The SD of this &ldquo;sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo; is called the &ldquo;standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo; or the &ldquo;standard error of the sample mean&rdquo;.</p><p>In other words, the &ldquo;standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo; is a measure of the variability of the sample mean. It tells us how much the sample mean is likely to deviate from the population mean, given a certain sample size. The smaller the &ldquo;standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo;, the more precise the sample mean is as an estimate of the population mean. This means, as the sample size increases, the &ldquo;standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean&rdquo; decreases, the sample mean becomes a more accurate estimate of the population mean.</p><p>$$SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$</p><p>SE is the Standard Error,<br>s is the standard deviation of the sample<br>n is the sample size</p><p>In our dataset if the salary column has mean_slary=50,000 then we know some observations will have less than 50K and others will have more than 50K.

In this case the odds of head coming or success is 1.</p><p>$$logodd(event=success) = log( \frac{p}{(1-p)})$$</p><p>$$p(event=success) = 1/2 = 0.5$$</p><p>$$logodd(event=success) = log( \frac{p}{(1-p)}) = log(\frac{.5}{1-.5}) = log(1) = 0$$</p><p>It is important to note that the log-odd of getting a head is zero only when the coin is fair, if the coin is not fair, the log-odd will be different.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-theoretical-probability-and-experimental-probability>What is the difference between theoretical probability and experimental probability?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-the-difference-between-theoretical-probability-and-experimental-probability aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Success probability of all the outcomes may not be the same. This you can know from historical data. For example, if you go to your friend&rsquo;s house without calling him, what is the probability you will find him at home? ½ or 50%. This is theoretical probability. But from your past experience you know out of 50 times he was available only 5 times. So success probability (experimental probability) your friend is at home is 5/50 = 1/10 = .1 = 10%.</p><p>Similarly in die through game theoretical probability of getting 2 is ⅙. But if die is tampored in the favor of 2 then the probability of getting is more than ⅙ or probability of getting any other number is less than ⅙.</p><p>If the stock-market opens today then will the share price of Infosys go up, or down or remain as it was on the last day? Theoretical probability of opening at a higher price is ⅓.

In this dataset, you have 10,000 applicants&rsquo; information. Now if you are interested in only those employees who are from Mumbai, then you can ask questions like, what is the probability that a given employee is from Mumbai? In the experiment, if you pick up record number 1008 and this candidate is from Mumbai then you call the event successful. But, if the candidate is from any other city then, you call the event a failure. You write it as $$Pr(Applicant_city=Mumbai)$$.</p><p>If this dataset has 2000 candidates from Mumbai then a randomly selected candidate will be from Mumbai, what is the probability? 2,000/10,000 = .20 or 20% so $$Pr(Applicant_City=Mumbai)=.20$$. 20% is the success probability.</p><p>Success probability is a little tricky in the case of a numeric variable. Because if you want to check the probability of a person whose age is 35 years, 3 months, 10 days, and 6 hours then the question is valid but the answer is Probability of success of this event is zero. You pick up any number and the answer is going to be like that. For example, when you say age is 30 years, it means 30 years, 0 months, 0 days, and 0 hours. Due to this reason with numeric probability you either use >= or &lt;=. It means you can ask a question like, what is the probability of Age of a candidate [&lt;=30, or >=30], or [>=30 but &lt;=35] years?</p><p>In our dataset, if we have 3000 people who are &lt;= 30 years then Pr(Applicant_Age&lt;=30) = .30 or 30%.</p><p>If our dataset has 5000 people &lt;=35 years then $$Pr(Applicant_Age&lt;=35) = .50$$ or 50%.</p><p>Now we can say Pr(Applicant_age>=30 and &lt;=35) = .50 - .30 = .20 or 20%.</p><p>This all is done by exploring another concept called probability density.</p><h2 id=what-is-probability-density>What is probability density?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-probability-density aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s assume our dataset has 10,000 applicants and their age is between 18 to 60 years. You can plot a histogram and this histogram represents the distribution of age of the applicants. The entire area of this histogram is referred to as 1, in our case 10,000 people&rsquo;s age is represented by this area and it is 1. This is the total density of this curve.

If we plot the distribution of earthquake size you will not have normal distribution, it will have exponential distribution. But if we were having an employee dataset and age is mentioned there then you can assume that age will have normal distribution. Because of assumption you can use a parametric test with a small dataset to conclude about the larger sample. Parametric tests like t-test can infer with sample size&lt;30, on the other hand parametric tests like z-test can infer about population with sample size around 30.</p><p>Nonparametric measures, on the other hand, <strong>do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.</strong> They are more flexible and can be <strong>used with a wider range of data types</strong>, but they may be <strong>less powerful</strong> than parametric measures because they make fewer assumptions about the data.</p><p>One of the main differences between parametric and nonparametric measures is the way they handle <strong>missing data</strong>. Parametric measures typically require complete datasets, while nonparametric measures are more robust to missing data.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to choose the appropriate statistical technique based on the nature of the data and the research question you are trying to answer. In general, parametric measures are more powerful when the assumptions they make about the data are met, but nonparametric measures may be more appropriate when these assumptions are not met.</p><h2 id=when-is-median-better-than-mean-measure>When is Median better than Mean measure?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#when-is-median-better-than-mean-measure aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>If you have 2 people in your dataset whose salary is 4 cr and 5 cr, then the mean will shift to the right side. If you have people whose salary is 4K or 5K means will shift left. In this situation if you want the central tendency of data to be correctly represented then use median.</p><h2 id=what-is-percentile>What is percentile?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-is-percentile aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s assume our job_applicant dataset has 500 observations. If you order the salary column in ascending order. 80 percentile means 80 percent of 500, i.e. 400th record. Whatever the salary of this 400th person is, that is 80 percentile. Let&rsquo;s say it is 75K. It means 20% of people have more salary than 75K and 80% people have a salary less than 75K.</p><p>If you want to know 99 percentile then 500*99/100 = 495th record. Let&rsquo;s say the 495th person&rsquo;s salary is 140K. It means 1% of the people have more than 140K salary.</p><h2 id=what-are-applications-of-long-tailed-distribution>What are applications of long-tailed distribution?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#what-are-applications-of-long-tailed-distribution aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Long-tailed distribution is when on the ends the shape of the normal distribution curve becomes almost parallel to the x-axis (asymptotic).

Salary information of the 500th person is 50th (Q2) percentile. Salary information of the 750th person is 75th (Q3) percentile. The difference between Q3 and Q1 salary is called IQR (Interquartile Range). If you add 1.5<em>IQR with Q3 you will get a salary, say 1.8 Lakh. Any salary more than this is considered a right side outlier. If you subtract 1.5</em>IQR from Q1 then you will get a number, say 40K.

Each distribution has its own shape and measure to summarize the data. They are broadly of three types, measure of central tendency, measure of dispersion and shape of distribution. Following are common measures for every distribution. For example, to calculate central tendencies like mean, median of normal distribution there is some formula. In the case of exponential distribution central tendencies will not be arithmetic mean but geometric mean.</p><ul><li>Mean, Median, Mode, Range, SD, Kurtosis, Coefficient of Variation, SD, Skewness</li><li><strong>Each measure has different formula for calculation</strong></li></ul><h2 id=some-additional-notes-for-data-scientists>Some Additional Notes for Data Scientists.<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#some-additional-notes-for-data-scientists aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>A data scientist is dealing with different streams of subjects like statistics, database, software engineering, geometry, vector and metrics, and calculus at the same time.
