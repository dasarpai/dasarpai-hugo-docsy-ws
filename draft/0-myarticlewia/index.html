Once I understood the meaning and philosophy I wanted to enjoy the singing and meaning both.</p><p>I can read Tamil letters but I do not know the meaning so my purpose was not fulfilled. Then I started looking for this treasure in Devanagari Script with Hindi Meaning. I searched but I could not find anyone PDF which I can print and use during my prayer. Keeping this goal in mind I extracted Devnagri text from <a href=https://www.geocities.ws/nvkashraf>this site</a>, correct the text in many places, and created this pdf file for Bhajan’s purpose.</p><p>If you wish, you can keep it in your collection of books for easy access. This is wonderful work and I recommend that one must read it and feel the meaning of this in day to day life.</p><p>Hindu’s dharma literature says there are four “Purushartha” of human life (purpose of life). Bhagwan Thiruvalluvar does not expect any human being to achieve Moksha in life but expects that a person lives divine life on the earth itself.</p><p>This book discusses Dharma, Artha, and Karma of life. To have better administration, better relations between humans of all faiths, respect and harmony with nature, a life full of happiness, etc this book is highly useful.

It is not because the Hindus have been a great fighter or defender but because of great knowledge and values in our Vedas and Upnishads and great saints who translated the same for us from time to time. Saints did this selflessly and people believed them blindly because of this selfless nature and the value which people saw in their teachings.</p><p>In the 21st century, Hindus and their religion will die if we do not return to Vedas or Upnishads. I do not spend time reading and understanding those. Scripture will not die, other religions will be created from those and existing will modify their interpretation in tune with Vedas and Upnishads without attributing the learning to the source. Hindus are not in danger because of any other religion. In fact, the time of barbaric behavior and imposing religion on others have gone. People are losing faith in this religion because of their sallow understanding, remaining busy in their bread earning job, doing useless rituals, visiting masked babas, visiting temples and making them a dirty place, giving money to temple and thinking that my job is over. How many of us, especially those who bother about the existence of the Hindu religion and the great teaching, really give time to read the Vedas, Upnishads, and realizing the truth through meditation.</p><p>In fact, today’s Hindus sing devotional songs on high speed, high volume senseless filmy songs, sings all the Aartis of all gods because of fear or many hopes from many gods, go to a temple to eat Prasad, go on pilgrimage to have great fun and enjoy a picnic. How can we save the Hindu civilization by these practices? In fact, we have become headless people with respect to Hindu practices. Besides all this we sometimes abuse our religion, sometimes appreciate others too much without seeing our values, sometimes blame other religions for our fall. We never have fallen so much in those 2000 years of attack, crusades, and missionaries as much we have fallen in the last 50 years.</p><p>Time to introspection for all the Hindus who want this great civilization should continue eternally as it is called Sanatana Dharma! We should behave like intellectuals and for that purpose return to Upnishads and Vedas. Start reading the translation of those done by our great sages or learn Sanskrit and meditation to do the same for yourself.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5004--greetings-for-new-year-2015>Article5004 : Greetings For New Year 2015<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5004--greetings-for-new-year-2015 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Annual Wishes]</p><p>Dear Friend,</p><p>I would like to wish you a healthy, rewarding and productive new year 2015 & Mary Christmas.</p><p>If you are living in India or doing business in India then I hope you agree with me that this year we have restored systems which is much stable, faithful and interested in the growth of all.

In our scripture, everything is told in the form of poetry, and therefore many times we get dragged into the rhythm, beauty of words, commandments, prayers, etc. But seldom we dwell in these words which can shake us vigorously. The simple word to word meaning of this sloka is as below.</p><p>There is a tree called Ashwath. Branches of this tree are downside and roots are upside. Vedas are its leaves of this tree, that who knows this tree is the knower of Vedas.</p><p>ऊर्ध्व= Upside, मूलम्‌=Root, अधः=Downside, शाखम्‌=Branch, अश्वत्थं=Ashwath Tree, प्राहुः=Told, अव्ययम्‌=Eternal |<br>छन्दांसि=Vedas, यस्य=Of this, पर्णानि=Leaves, यः=That, तम्‌=Whom, वेद=Known, स=He, वेदवित्‌=Knower<br>Although every chapter, every sloka, and every word of the Bhagwat Geeta is extremely important but in the Hindu tradition, many of the traditional people emphasize the importance of learning this whole chapter which contains 20 slokas. Most of the traditional people recite those 20 slokas of this chapter before taking food, so sometimes it looks that this chapter reminds us about food. Anyway, this was the lighter side of this sloka. Analysis of the sloka is below.</p><p>First, this sloka is talking about a tree. The tree, which is not seen in the world by the physical eyes.<br>Second, this sloka is talking about the importance of “knowing” this tree. It says that a person is the knower of Vedas.</p><p>A tree has leaves, fruits, branches, seeds. So this sloka also encourages us to think about all these aspects of this tree. Sloka says leaves are Vedas. But what about fruits? They are Karmafale. What about branches? They are Karma. What about the seed? That is desire. Of whose desire? The desire of Brahman (the supreme reality).<br>So by doing Vedic duties & worldly karma you nurture this tree. So you get the karma fala in life which you enjoy. Sometimes the fruits are sweet and other times it has a different taste. Sometimes you like the taste and other times you do not. You do not have a choice of eating different fruit than the fruit for which you have done karma. If you do not like fruit then do not blame fruit but introspect your own karma.</p><p>Sloka says this tree is eternal. The entire world rests on this tree and enjoys the bad or good fala of karma. This tree is an inverted tree. Have you ever seen an inverted tree anywhere? Go on the river bank, and see the shadow of the tree in the river, it is an inverted tree. So which tree is real the tree in the water of a river or on the bank of the river. So this sloka is trying to tell us that the world where we enjoy karma fala is not the real world. It is a shadow world. The real world is something different. Where is the real world and how far it is away from the unreal world? The real-world and unreal worlds are at the same distance as the shadow of a tree and the real tree on the river bank. They both exist simultaneously. One which is perceived by the physical eyes is not real, one which is known by inner sense is the real. The shadow of the tree does not have its own existence, it depends upon the real tree. This is called Maya. Maya means it exists but its reality depends upon something else. The shape of the shadow of a tree is the same as the real tree. In absence of light, you cannot see the shadow tree but it does not mean that the real tree also has washed away in the river water. But do we have this much time to bother about the reality? We get dragged into the world knowing that everything here is an absolute reality.</p><p>Further sloka says that those who know about this tree are the real knower of the Vedas. It means the purpose of the Vedas is to reveal this tree to us. Those who know the invertedness of this tree is not a reality, but there is a real tree that cannot be seen by the physical eyes, he knows the Vedas. We need to understand the sharpest knowledge senses (eye, skin, ear, nose, tongue) of a human can deceive him/her, but the sharpest intellect with a balanced emotional mind that has a strong desire to understand reality cannot be deceived. So the reality of the Vedas cannot be known and enjoyed by physical senses but by pure intellect and pure mind.</p><p>In the following sloka, Bhagwat Geeta says that only those who know this tree can cut it. And cutting is the only solution if you want to come out endless life-death cycle and enjoying the good and bad fruits of this tree. But because this is not about the physical reality of the physical sense therefore cutting is also not physical. Here cutting means dropping the sense of reality about unreal. It is only possible by Vairagya (renunciation).</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5007--greetings-for-new-year-2017>Article5007 : Greetings For New Year 2017<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5007--greetings-for-new-year-2017 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;Annual Wishes&rsquo;]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>In our life, a new day comes every day<br>but only once in 365 days a new day also comes with the new year.<br>Like the circle of 360 degrees, 365 days of a year also represents a circle of time.<br>Only a few who learn from the previous circle and<br>plan for a new circle move vertically in the circle<br>and create a spring of evolution in life.<br>For others, it is like moving around the same circle throughout life,<br>like in the picture above.</p><p>What you learn and in what sense you evolve<br>from one year to another depends upon you.<br>Some collect bitter memories and experiences and<br>others in all circumstances collect good memories and experiences.</p><p>If you are an atheist then I assure you that next year<br>I will be with you to create positive experiences in your life<br>whenever you want just remember me and I will do my bit for you.</p><p>If you are an Astika and believe in many Gods<br>then I pray to all your gods that help my friend<br>in achieving all whatever Sattva s/he wants to get in his/her life.</p><p>If you are an Astika and believe in only one god<br>then I pray to that one God that please help my friend<br>in living with you in all the walk of his/her life<br>and may your love shower upon her/him for the whole year.</p><p>If you are Astika and believe in Ishwara of Advaita Vedanta then<br>I meditate with you to be one with unmanifested God<br>and manifest all the virtues in nature and lives around in the next year.</p><p>Wish you a very happy, healthy, joyful new year ahead.</p><p>Love & Regards<br>Hari Thapliyaal</p><h1 id=article5008--greetings-for-new-year-2019>Article5008 : Greetings For New Year 2019<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5008--greetings-for-new-year-2019 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;Annual Wishes&rsquo;]</p><p>Dear Friends</p><p>We suffer ONLY in present.

My content is hosted on Hostgator therefore I should enter HostGator DNS on GoDaddy site (it was learning for me) -><br>22. If I want Cloudflare should work then DNS records provided by Cloudflare should be entered -><br>23. I tried, now emails are not bouncing but not getting delivered as well -><br>24. I research this issue further and come to know that this is a common problem that Cloudflare and email compatibility issue exist and lot of struggle to make it work -><br>25. Disabled my Cloudflare services for my domain on Cloudflare site -><br>26. Made GoDaddy DNS entry as default -><br>27. Now my website site stopped working-><br>28. Come to know that changes will be effective in 24-48 hours, so wait-><br>29. But then realized that DNS entry should be of Hostgator because that is the place where content is hosted -><br>30. So changed the DNS on hostgator, now domain is working -><br>31. Still I don’t have any new domain which I can use to purchase Microsoft 365 office business license-><br>32. Used my third domain RXXX-><br>33. Earlier I was not using this because I didn’t want to confuse my licensing with too many unrelated domains but now I have no solution -><br>34. Created new Microsoft office 365 account with RXXX domain-><br>35. Now wanted to purchase the license but now it says the cost of the business license itself equal to the cost which I was paying for Office 365 Home Edition + GST. And GST is extra. so the whole exercise is futile-><br>36. Started looking for an alternative of office 365 -> Found libre 6.2.4 & Polaris Office 2017 -><br>37. Download and tried but only Polaris is a little bit near to Office 365 -><br>38. Finally took the decision this year I will not use Office 365 and manage with Polaris, free license, or if required professional license. If this does not serve my purpose and a need arises during my data science work then only I will purchase-><br>39. Finally open GST billing data in Polaris software</p><p>The whole 12 hours went to into drain and at 10 pm, I am proceeding for GST Annual Finally</p><p>I am sure many of you have burned someday of your life like this.

Don’t mistake it for the brain.<br>The brain is physical and it is located inside the physical head.<br>A perceiving mind is not a matter, but it matters a lot.<br>This non-matter which matters is not located in one place.<br>The whole body is the home of the mind.</p><p>How the whole body has a mind?<br>Let’s understand, what is the mind.<br>This English term mind is very confusing.<br>In Indian Yogic terms, there is nothing called a mind.<br>In Yoga we have terms like Manas, Chitta, Buddhi, Ahamkar, Pragya.<br>Manas is not Mind. Buddhi is not Intellect.<br>Ahamkara is not Ego. There is no equivalent Chitta in English.<br>Pragya has many meanings in English.</p><p>Scope of the English word mind is following 11 activities<br>defining, feeling, thinking, sensing, perceiving, intuiting,<br>judging, associating, discriminating, assimilating, and creating.<br>(feel free to add more if I missed adding that here)</p><p>In Yoga Manas is a pool of thought and nothing else.<br>Once thoughts disappear there is no Manas.</p><p>Buddhi is a facility to analyze events, objects around us<br>in the smallest possible units and<br>seeing the sequence and parallelism etc.</p><p>Ahamkara is self-identification with the help of things<br>that are associated with you. Including body, mind, intellect,<br>relations, car, bank balance, property, position, relations, etc.</p><p>Chitta is a memory (Smriti) pool. There are two kinds of memories.<br>One, which is part of your body cells<br>which makes your body structure,<br>color of your skin, the shape of your body parts, etc.<br>The second kind of Chitta is, which is non-local, universal.<br>You can connect to it and access the huge amount of information stored there.<br>It is timeless, space-less but available to you<br>only when you slip temporarily in that timelessness.</p><p>Pragya is intelligence and wisdom to assimilate<br>and understand the oneness of entire existence.</p><p>Because of English education, most of us<br>will not be able to understand these terms at the experiential level,<br>so I will continue using the term mind.</p><p>Today somebody in my circle asked me<br>can we measure the mind?<br>Based on my experience I can say the mind is not measured. It measures.<br>It is like a scale. Scale measures but not measured, except for calibration purposes.<br>In the case of mind, what is that which works as a calibrator of mind?<br>Every scale has a unit of measurements<br>and for the mind, the Unit is a pleasure.</p><p>Pleasure for every mind is different.<br>Therefore in a human to human relative sense,<br>it looks there is no need for a calibrator.<br>With the expansion of Pragya mind calibrates itself.<br>Pleasure comes through mental or physical actions<br>but it is perceived only by the mind.<br>Pleasure is no different from pain.<br>It is like a coin of exchange that has<br>two parts called pleasure and pain.<br>But, we still referring to that coin as pleasure.</p><p>Pleasure and pain are closely related to<br>your association with those objects<br>on which the events are happening.</p><p>Too much cold and heat on our skin give us too much pain.<br>The same cold and heat on your friend’s skin give less pain to you.<br>And the same cold and heat on some poor person’s skin,<br>that is breaking the stone on the road, give you further less pain.<br>The same cold and heat on someone who is far away from your land,<br>language, religion makes you indifferent,<br>unless you are a human rights professional<br>and make your money by that sensationalization work.<br>Too much temperature torture<br>to a terrorist or criminal in jail gives you pleasure.</p><p>This way you can expand this concept of pleasure and pain<br>from heat and cold to your wealth, position, respect, status, title, etc.<br>In a nutshell of whatever mind is aware<br>and attached it feels pleasure and pain.</p><p>Sometime back I mentioned <a href=https://wia.dasarpai.com/prisoner-of-the-mind/>Prisoner of Mind,</a><br>In that sense, you feel pleasure and pain till<br>the time you are a prisoner of the mind.</p><p>Is it possible to break the prison of mind?<br>Yes, it is possible. It is as easy as seeing your eyes<br>without using any reflection like the mirror, water etc.<br>Is it easy? Of course Yes and No, simultaneously.</p><p>How to see your own mind without any help from outside?<br>No help from friends, books, religion, etc.<br>How to introspect your own mind?<br>If you find something then share techniques with me.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5016--the-way-of-mother>Article5016 : The Way Of Mother<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5016--the-way-of-mother aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;My Story&rsquo;, Philosophy]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>A twelve years old boy in a deep mountain<br>quite engrossed in his play with crops, trees, mud, cattle, and fountain.<br>He had a mother and other siblings<br>His mother used to scold him and sometimes beat him for his mischief.<br>Boy was very angry and questioned why my mother is unfair to me.<br>One day he asked his mother.

Sometimes exerts their power but not always.<br>They enjoy life and have the capability of doing hard penance to acquire energy, power and transform themselves and things around at will.</p><p><strong>The third is Asura, which is not Sura (some people call them Devil, Rakshasa, Saitan, and other countless derogatory terms).</strong><br>But if we have some understanding of Hindu Pauranic scriptures then we will not make this mistake.<br>Asuras are not and never were Devil, Rakshasa, or Saitan.<br>Asuras are very hardworking people and they can perform severe penance like Sura.<br>They also work for a mission and has the power to transform.<br>They enjoy life but for that, they need to trouble others or dull their own senses.<br>Because they think if mind work or senses are sharp it creates problems so let’s park them for some time.<br>Consuming all kind of food and liquid which increases their sleep and make their mind dull or sometimes aggressive.</p><p><strong>How Three Kind of Human Exists Together?</strong></p><p>Now see how they coexist in a society.<br>Sura and Asuras are in a continuous ideological fight with each other.<br>Common human pray to Suras to get favor and pray to Asura avoid their wrath and outrage.<br>In this eternal fight sometimes Asuras win and sometimes Suras win.<br>Sometimes Suras rule heaven and sometimes Asuras rule heaven.</p><p>Heaven is a special place with lots of luxuries, where things happen at just wish or pressing a button.<br>It is like a highly automated 100th generation super technologically enabled place.<br>If you are the king of that place then even living being with you behave like an advanced AI Robot.<br>They obey you 100% and take responsibility for the failure if they fail but never makes you upset.<br>(Don’t run in the weird imagination of heaven in the sky.

Do more for themselves and less or none for others<br>but want help or praise or awards for themselves.<br>If you don’t give them as per their desire they are masters and experts in creating problems.<br>They threaten others and not much help to others.<br>If they help then they will help only to their community or their kind of people.</p><p>If you praise a common person, once in a week or a month prayer is fine.<br>They want it but don’t expect much because they know,<br>Anyway, I have to continue my life without praise from others.<br>He cannot threaten others nor can give a reward to others.

others are false gods.<br>Omkara Dharma tradition says we know all this for ages<br>For the last two thousand years,<br>you are not telling us anything new.<br>This knowledge is it is part of<br>our Upanishads since many millennia.<br>This knowledge also has been<br>a realization by many great people</p><p>But we don’t care about that one<br>because if God is like a chief minister or president<br>who is not available because of far relationship<br>Then, I am as an emotional being<br>cannot connect to him<br>then he is of no use for me.</p><p>When my close relatives can solve my problem<br>then why should I bother about that one who is too far?<br>And no one around me knows him surely<br>about that one God who is controlling everything from heaven.<br>All are reading a book and telling me about that from their books.<br>The problem is NOT the book.<br>The problem is that they have put hard effort to memorize that text<br>and now torturing me with that old illogical text<br>which they themselves have not assimilated.</p><p>So I feel joy when I meditate or sing or dance<br>or feed someone who is close to me, nearer to me.<br>At least he responds and gives me an opportunity to live with him.</p><p>This mass prayer in a public place<br>is just a tool for someone to gain and retain power.<br>It doesn’t help me much<br>until I am troubled badly by some external notorious forces.<br>For me my Mother who is Durga, Kaali, Saraswati<br>who takes rest in my money purse,<br>on the alter in my Pooja room,<br>whose photo is hanging on the wall<br>reminds me always that She is around me<br>Like the photo of any other close friend or relatives<br>on the wall reminds me of their love.</p><p>How much is the truth that she is protecting me?<br>Omkar dharma tradition also knows that<br>there exists an unbreakable law of Karma.<br>My Devta or Devi who is my mother or sister or friend<br>helps me sustaining both the pain and pleasure of this law.</p><p>This relative of mine will never bend the rule.<br>We don’t expect magical or unnatural things from this power.<br>That is how Omkara dharma tradition and science can coexist.</p><p>From where we got this notion of God doing magic?<br>only one God, one culture, one language, one tradition, one law.<br>This is a western concept.<br>They developed it because it fitted them for many centuries to rule.<br>This “one” is the language of a ruler.<br>To consolidate the power so that management is easy.<br>It is the ruler’s perspective. That has some value.</p><p>But as a human, society, and culture<br>we never want to be governed by another human, society, and culture.<br>There are enough powerful forces within the society<br>who can balance other parts so that individuals can live sensibly?<br>But this is possible only in a democracy<br>Where human is valued and human is a seeker<br>Not when human lives like a dog<br>with blind faith in written books or merciful master.</p><p>In Indian traditions, every relation has a name<br>No matter how far is that relation<br>Whether the mother side or father side,<br>From wife side or husband side<br>One generation back or 4 generations back<br>There is some unique name for it</p><p>This is the impact of western culture upon us that<br>All relation has dried for us<br>Or they have a plain simple name.<br>a name like uncle, aunt, mom, dad, bro, sis<br>And sometimes shamelessly referring<br>to parents with their first name<br>Even our sacred and pure relation<br>with our Devi and Devta has become relation with God!</p><p>This God has come in public life.<br>My Devi or Devta is my private matter<br>I don’t know who is God, nor bother about that.<br>My Ista Devata or Devi is not available for public discussion<br>It is my sacred and pious relation</p><p>We are the land of the seeker<br>We are the land of practical people<br>We believe in using everything in a very sensible way<br>We believe in interacting with everything in a sensible way</p><p>We don’t care about old white long gown wearing person<br>hanging in the sky and controlling this world<br>We feel in our experience that<br>If I go to the forest with my cows<br>my Krishan comes with me and protects me and my cows<br>That is the power of a relationship.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Your Truly

city.</p><p>After settling there on a hill rock<br>I asked him what are you doing?<br>Where are you nowadays?<br>Where are you settled?</p><p>As soon as he listened the word settle<br>he became a little nostalgic.<br>After some time he told me<br>Oh, settlement! I will tell you my journey,<br>and then he started.</p><p>I am a child from a very small village of this nation<br>After education, I moved to the city to earn my living<br>There I got a lot to learn and little to earn<br>Here in this city one day I am met, my cousin<br>He asked me, brother, what are doing?<br>When are you getting settled?</p><p>I told him since the last three years I working in this city<br>Changed my jobs three times<br>because of reasons beyond my control<br>I never complained about those but I wanted to get settled.</p><p>I am trying, but it is not happening<br>In spite of all this, I am happy<br>Because I have learned so many things<br>in a short time in this strange city.</p><p>My cousin told me learning is fine<br>But where is the earning?<br>See me.

Why?</p><p>Because I thought settlement means<br>Having a big apartment in the best society in the city.<br>Having children and Giving them the best education.<br>Helping them getting settled in their job & life.<br>Buy the costliest car and show it to my friends.<br>Take all of them on a long ride and enjoy yourself with them.</p><p>Before getting old and dying,<br>see all the place on this planet,<br>as if this the first and last time here.<br>Because they are saying “Jindagi Na Milegi Dobara”<br>And if possible go and see the moon also.</p><p>Eat everything and drink everything possible,<br>because that is why God has created<br>all these things for we human<br>Apart from that human is also creating<br>so many interesting technologies to enjoy<br>It is not for me then for

them and be liberated.</p><p>Different people applied this framework for different purposes.<br>But Advaita Vedantins used it to proof<br>that there is no duality in the world.<br>This world is not created by anyone.<br>“This world is that who created it.”<br>At one level of existence mass and energy is same.<br>And both has come from no-thing.<br>This no-thing is consciousness<br>This is very lofty idea of Advaita Vendata<br>After millions of years research that is their conclusion.</p><p>Today’s physical science’s march towards the String theory<br>Is trying to conclude the same<br>Which is concluded by Advaita Vedantins<br>using these six sources of evidence</p><p>You can call these six as source of Evidence<br>or six tools to gain the knowledge<br>about the objects, events and relations around us.</p><p>They said if you want to know the truth about anything<br>then you should look that from different angles,<br>sources and validate that using different techniques.</p><p>Once it passes all the tests<br>then only it can be called true knowledge<br>otherwise it may be just your belief or illusion around.</p><p>For that they have given us six sources<br>from which conclusion can be derived.<br>Many traditions even in Omkara Dharma<br>does not follow all these six techniques.<br>Abhramic religion also does not rely<br>on all these six sources of knowledge<br>or sometimes heavily only on one source.</p><p>Similar is the situation of today’s modern science.<br>Based on your experience<br>you can share with me<br>which source of knowledge is predominant<br>in your life or your work domain.</p><p>Now, what are those six.</p><p>First, Direct evidence- “Pratyksha”:<br>It means our senses are in direct contact with the objects.<br>What our five sense organs can show us<br>that becomes the source of knowledge for us.</p><p>In day to day life, you know about the objects<br>using this technique, because your senses touches them.<br>Eye touches color & form, ear touches sound etc.</p><p>But sometimes no matter<br>what finer equipment we use to see, hear etc<br>we cannot know the reality.<br>For example while living on this planet<br>no matter what sense we use<br>we will never know that earth is revolving<br>in the space at mind blowing speed<br>of 67000 miles per hour around the sun<br>and on its axis around 1000 miles per hour.</p><p>Second, Inference – “Anumaan”:<br>If we know the relationship between two<br>and one we can see<br>then second can be inferred from logical deduction.</p><p>We know if fume is there then fire must also be there.<br>If sky looking blue it must day and sun will in visible sky,<br>If there is water in the glass under the tree and nobody around<br>it means some human lives around here.</p><p>In these cases if we see the effect we deduce there is cause.<br>Note: Reverse is not true.</p><p>Third, Compare – “Upmaan”:<br>For example you have seen a object in the market<br>but you don’t know what is that.<br>Then one day at your friend’s house<br>you find your friend is using that kind of equipment<br>and you ask him what is this and he says it is VR camera<br>then because of comparison<br>between this and that which you saw in market (now in your mind)<br>you conclude that what you saw in market was VR camera.</p><p>Fourth, Postulated – “Arthapatti”:<br>You called your friend and then go you to his home.<br>You knock the door but door is already open.<br>You call him, search inside but he is nowhere.<br>So you sit in the hall and wait for him. Why?<br>Because you postulated based on the evidences<br>around that he is not in house,<br>he must be nearby and he will come soon.</p><p>Fifth, Absense – “Anuplabdhi”:<br>If you call to school and ask that<br>you want to talk to you child and<br>principal says he is absent today<br>you conclude he has gone somewhere else,<br>either movie or to some friend’s house.</p><p>So absence of object at a place<br>gives you knowledge that boy is at other place.<br>But you don’t deny his existence.<br>Because based on other sources of knowledge<br>you know he exists but where you need to search.</p><p>Six, Trustworthy person or source – “Shabda”:<br>If some Nobel prize winner is medical science<br>in cancer research is saying something<br>about the cancer treatment & symptom<br>Then you trust him.<br>You make his work the basis of your further research.<br>You can quote him and his work freely without doubt.<br>Or some articles published by Albert Einstein in 1950<br>can be referred to base your research<br>even if, he is no more physically live around.</p><p>In first time reading, it may be confusing for you.<br>Trust me, I was like you few years back.<br>So nothing new, in this.</p><p>Every sources has its limitation.<br>No one is complete.<br>That is why to get the full picture all should be used.</p><p>Today I don’t want to make it complicated for you.<br>If you are more interested in this then search on your own<br>or let me know I will expand this in future.<br>This is very interesting topic for the seekers.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5029--who-is-guru>Article5029 : Who Is Guru<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5029--who-is-guru aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Education, Guru, Guru Purnima, &lsquo;Indian Culture&rsquo;, Philosophy]</p><p>We all know the Samskrut definition of Guru<br>The remover of darkness.<br>But whose darkness?<br>How does he remove?<br>What is this darkness about?<br>What is the meaning of remove?</p><p>In Omkara Dharma tradition,<br>Knowledge & Wisdom has been so important<br>that from the time immemorial<br>Many people came forward.<br>At the time of leaving for the cause of Knowledge & Wisdom<br>Some of these people had comfortable life and some didn’t</p><p>But, one thing was common.<br>The concern for the humanity and selflessness<br>Selflessness means they didn’t start new journy<br>for their personal gain and glory</p><p>Concern for humanity means<br>Compassion, love, respect, forgiveness<br>is diminishing among the human of society<br>People in the society are becoming so<br>Self-centrist that whether this life or post death life<br>They just look for their comfort<br>That too at the cost of other around them<br>So, to bring the society to the<br>center of humanity</p><p>Guru is not a proper name it is a common name<br>It is like prime minister or president<br>Whoever fill that position is called prime minister<br>But prime minister is position of democratic system<br>Guru is position which is neither democratic or self procalimed<br>It always existed in the Omakara Dharma tradition</p><p>According to different Sampradaya<br>They say first Guru is Shiva or Vishnu or Brahma<br>Some wise people say they all are same<br>Some say they are different position<br>Some even say they are not proper noun<br>But common noun.</p><p>A power which destruct is Shiva<br>A power which maintains is Vishnu<br>A power which creates is Brahama<br>But these powers are not physical in nature</p><p>Like if your remove a person<br>from a prime minister position<br>What happens to person?

Food.</p><p>Our mind is searching for food for himself<br>Whole day variety of food for the mind<br>Without giving any food,<br>It is not easy to set your mind at rest</p><p>Till we are awake either body<br>is looking something through mind<br>or the mind is looking for itself.</p><p>But why mind is looking for food all the time?<br>Does it want to know more?<br>Does it want to Experience more?<br>Or simply it is never trained<br>to simply sit and watch the breath!</p><p>A mind can search the whole day and get tired<br>but still like it and<br>then the next day go again.</p><p>It is not that easy for mind to search in awareness and with breath<br>Why? Because, there are high chances<br>That normal mind will completely get lost<br>In pure awareness of the self<br>And normally mind is not ready to get lost.<br>For him it is defeat!</p><p>How mind explore, learn, and get absorbed?<br>Focus on breath and you will learn about the body,<br>Focus on dynamics inside stomach<br>and know what is going inside.<br>Look on the moon and mind explores the same<br>And sometimes tearing a leaf or flower,<br>Like a child in curiosity for what?<br>Exploring, learning, and experiencing!</p><p>Generally in the context of mind<br>we say search inside or outside<br>But the mind does not have that kind of boundary<br>It is spread everywhere.<br>For mind outside is inside, if it absorbed!<br>And inside is outside,<br>if it is able to inspire the surrounding.</p><p>Learning in human life is the core process<br>It gives us survival capability.<br>Ability to choose between flight and fight<br>But this is available to all creatures<br>Through the learning of millions of years<br>Our body cells have that infused knowledge.</p><p>Using a mind for survival is too much overuse of the mind<br>It is like using a heavy weapon to kill an insect<br>For human, a mind opens the gate of realization.<br>Something which cannot be directly sensed, perceived.</p><p>A journey of learning starts in our life<br>when parents guide us,<br>we may learn or fail to learn there,<br>then the teacher teaches us and we fail or pass in the class,<br>Our friends and society teaches us continuously,<br>From this, we may accomplish something or not is immaterial.<br>What matters is we are learning and experiencing.</p><p>Daily we observe lives around,<br>without the help of any other being.<br>We see some patterns and try to assimilate,<br>the meaning of happenings.<br>We may succeed or fail to assimilate that learning.<br>But mind keep trying with one more step</p><p>How do we know that we have learned?<br>when we see contrary patterns<br>Or we do something and<br>the outcome is not as expected<br>Then we learn that we have not learned enough<br>Or we not learned correctly</p><p>Learning is a life long process<br>Therefore even if you learn wrong<br>Or you make a mistake<br>There is nothing wrong,<br>In making mistake or doing wrong.<br>But the condition is you should be self-aware<br>An awareness which is free,<br>From the guilt of mistake and fear of blame</p><p>Ancient wisdom traditions say<br>One-fourth of learning come from a teacher<br>One forth from friends and society<br>One forth come from experiments<br>Final one forth come with time, passage of life.<br>There is no shortcut for the fourth</p><p>The source of learning is the question<br>Not the borrowed question!<br>But those which made you sleepless and restless</p><p>Depth of learning doesn’t depend upon<br>How much we have read<br>But how much we could assimilate<br>Assimilation of knowledge is not possible with borrowed questions</p><p>The best teacher in life is a question<br>If by the time children finish their education<br>Teachers can teach them how to ask questions,<br>Related to the subject of their interest<br>Then we can say a college education is complete.</p><p>A Master degree doesn’t mean I have become a master<br>But it means by now I know<br>that how Limited I know<br>And this is the door opening for new life.</p><p>Our teachers should tell us that<br>An answer is that<br>which settles some aspect of life.</p><p>But no matter, How much you read<br>It will not settle any aspect of your life.<br>You need to move to next step.<br>Reading and Listening conditions us.<br>Is reading or listening bad?<br>No, it helps us in asking questions<br>But it happens to a seeking mind<br>Asking those questions on which we can put our life<br>And seek the answers on our own<br>No copy and paste of guru, book, notebook, teacher or parents</p><p>Why do we fail to ask the right questions?<br>Because we are in a hurry of generalizing knowledge.<br>This takes us away from the context<br>And we fail to understand correctly.</p><p>We need to understand generalisation<br>in knowledge is a very heavy load process.<br>We need to have huge experience and knowledge<br>before we generalize the idea or concept.</p><p>How should we ask questions?<br>The way a child asks, with inquisitiveness,<br>perseverance, trial, application<br>And all on the self!</p><p>If I learn anything in such a way<br>that my wrong understanding can cause<br>Serious loss to me or my dearest<br>Then I will never fail to learn correctly.<br>Thus, we should keep in mind that<br>the right understanding is important.</p><p>Why do we fail to learn correctly in class?<br>Because we don’t know,<br>The consequence of poor learning is<br>A bad doctor, engineer, pilot, politician.</p><p>Why do we fail to learn?<br>Because of borrowed questions.<br>Because of no relevance to the questioner’s life.<br>Because of no context.<br>Because of no application.</p><p>So learning is important.<br>But how to learn?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1

How and why?<br>Because that person has learned<br>the science behind the subject.</p><p>If you learn the basic rule and formula of drawing fine arts<br>or music then it is less art and more science for you.<br>It is fun and while dancing on the board<br>you can draw the best picture</p><p>If musician learn how to think the way<br>computer processes code<br>then it is science for him to write code.<br>While talking to his friend<br>he can develop a new algorithm.</p><p>Where do we learn science?<br>Initially our parents, teachers, mentors,<br>experienced professionals teach this to us.<br>They also teach us how to pay attention<br>to the surrounding so that we can learn the rule on our own.</p><p>All training institutes, schools, colleges, universities<br>helps us downloading that science to us<br>which either they have developed,<br>or received from the previous generations<br>or peers around them.</p><p>To learn the art of a profession<br>there are few places<br>but to learn the science of a profession<br>there are many places.</p><p>After we have learned<br>the old science of the profession in the classroom,<br>There is a life before us to discover new science<br>from the art (complexities) of our profession.</p><p>Initially even riding a bicycle is art.<br>After learning the rules, it becomes science.<br>It looks anybody can do it.</p><p>So in every science, there is an art for us,<br>which we are not able to comprehend</p><p>And in every art, there is some science for us<br>which we can easily teach to others<br>Repeat and produce exactly the same outcome as before.</p><p>But learning does not end,<br>when we have understood all the rules of the profession<br>Learning takes new heights<br>then we start observing new patterns on our own</p><p>Sometimes we see such patterns<br>which nobody observed before<br>This is called removing the cover lying on some art<br>Once we remove the cover it is a discovery<br>And now it is no more art for you<br>Now, it becomes science.</p><p>What is science today,<br>Was miracle for most of the human sometimes back.<br>But it never happens that today’s science<br>will become the art of tomorrow.</p><p>Once we know how it works then<br>There is no magic, no hidden rule<br>Any person willing to put efforts to follow the steps<br>will be able to reproduce<br>that which is expected by the process.</p><p>Therefore, when in class we pay most attention<br>To learn the rules of the profession<br>Whether art or engineering or medical<br>or music or programming<br>Whether a teacher is boring or interesting<br>Keep your subject live in your mind.</p><p>Apply your common sense<br>And observations to assimilate<br>what is being explained<br>Then experiment with that rule to experience the outcome.</p><p>When you are done then you have<br>assimilated the basic rules of the profession</p><p>Sometimes if you sit near a giant master<br>Of the profession, you will learn<br>Such rules which only he knows<br>Because he observed it by doing<br>It is not written anywhere</p><p>If you learn those rules then<br>your life becomes easy<br>because you need not discover that jewel again.</p><p>Unfortunately many of the people<br>In the profession don’t pay much attention and time to learn the rules<br>They want to finish the work in hand by hook or crook<br>Make money, get awards and recognition<br>But not ready to learn the basic rules or processes.</p><p>If we don’t know even basic rule then<br>where is the scope of observing patterns of a new problem?<br>In this situation forget about<br>scope of developing your own rules,<br>Those rules, which you can share with<br>your colleagues and family members</p><p>Just copy-pasting text<br>from one window to another window, doesn’t help.<br>Storing file on the hard disk or on bookshelves doesn’t help<br>Things will always remain mysterious for you.</p><p>Just because you have seen some video<br>or read text doesn’t give you the confidence<br>that you have learned the rule.</p><p>There are many high tech gadgets around us or in our hand<br>And we don’t know how it works!<br>Neither people are interested in learning<br>Nor it is possible for all to learn all.</p><p>But there must be one field in our life<br>For which you know most of the rule<br>It has become a science for us<br>And, we still enjoy that profession<br>Because we still see some patterns there<br>which we didn’t know before</p><p>Many experts in our field don’t know about those<br>But we can do that like an artist<br>Sometimes an artist puts a stroke on the canvas<br>and a beautiful piece comes up.<br>Not because he wanted to make good art,<br>But because he has perfected the science so much that<br>He cannot make a mistake<br>And someday, If he deviates from the science<br>then the product is a fantastic art</p><p>When you are engaged with nature in such a way<br>then Life is fun, more joyful and playful</p><p>Life becomes boring and tiresome when<br>It rolls from month to month.<br>From one customer to another customer,<br>From one delivery to another delivery,<br>From one paycheck to the next paycheck.<br>From one promotion to another.<br>From one birthday to the next birthday.<br>From one Friday to next Friday party.<br>This way we look excuse to celebrate<br>the moments of life.</p><p>But when you are committed to the process<br>where converting art to science is a game of every moment<br>then every moment is a thrill.<br>Every moment is a festival and joy.</p><p>Hari

relationship.<br>How much we interact and transact in a relationships<br>that decides the degree of strength of the relationship.<br>Both feelings are not good for positive strong relations.</p><p>So, when one says I am not related to that,<br>It means, he is saying I don’t have any emotions for him<br>Or I have negative emotions for that<br>Or the degree of positive emotions is very weak<br>Or the

around you.<br>Without any purpose why somebody wants<br>a particular quality and strength of relationships with you?</p><p>If you say, we both decide<br>then it is a transactional relationship<br>and

can win the war, it doesn’t mean<br>that always hug and kiss to win the war.</p><p>It also means without being negative<br>you can demolish your enemy.</p><p>In the Mahabharat war, there is mention of

book.</p><p>The initial purpose of creating religion was not that bad.<br>It was a mass healing tool<br>It was a tool to discipline people<br>A tool to create a stable society<br>A tool to create a knowledge base<br>and transfer the knowledge to other people around<br>and to the next generation.</p><p>Without religion, it was not possible at all<br>to come this far in human civilization as we have come today.</p><p>Initially, Religion and power were integrated<br>Slowly more independent thinker started coming<br>challenging the book and the ruler<br>These people were suppressed and out-casted<br>When these independent thinkers made more sense to the masses<br>then they have their own followers.</p><p>When the new thinker dies<br>his thinking and teaching becomes another book<br>And his followers became religious.</p><p>This business of reading, writing, and<br>teaching is going on for many centuries.</p><p>Those who cannot read<br>someone else will read on their behalf<br>Those who cannot write<br>someone else write on their behalf.</p><p>But, what happens if someone is not able to understand.<br>Or understand something which is against<br>the ruler and leader of the religion.<br>In that case, a so-called learned will translate<br>and make sure people understand<br>what religious leader and ruler wants to say<br>not what is written or what is good for the masses.</p><p>Over a period of time so many other subjects<br>has evolved for reading, writing, and teaching purpose<br>A huge knowledge base is created around the new subjects.</p><p>But old books remain always popular<br>Not because they have teachings for human<br>about how to live sensibly with other people around<br>But because those are the tools of mass psychology,<br>a tool to control and rule.</p><p>Who, in power or religion,<br>bothers truly about the life of the citizens?<br>Everybody is interested either in their ruling or surviving.</p><p>People go for the mass reading of their books<br>They come and sit at one place<br>Sometimes reading books in public places<br>Sometimes reading with high volume speakers<br>Not to prove that they are educated<br>But to prove that they are faithful towards their religion.</p><p>Read the same book, many times a day,<br>every month, for years, read the same book<br>Even for generations the same book</p><p>If that much enthusiasm is there to read science,<br>technology, politics, mathematics,<br>environment, engineering, medical</p><p>If people could graduate in those<br>public reading classes from one level to another level.</p><p>If people could show so much<br>energy level for the group study of other subjects</p><p>If people could congratulate each other<br>for their graduation in those public reading classes</p><p>Then, this world could have been a more humanly plane to live.</p><p>But even after many years of human evolution<br>Unfortunately, a human is still stuck in those<br>Old books, which are not able to create human well being,<br>peace on the planet, respect for the environment,<br>respect for other creatures and other humans around</p><p>And, still, we call human has evolved from<br>an animal being to a human being.<br>Do you think so?</p><p>Even with all so-called science and technology<br>Human is still wildest animal on this planet<br>If you don’t believe that then<br>Next 5 years remove all religious books<br>Remove their ten commandments<br>Remove their fear of hell and heaven<br>Remove their fear of the law of karma<br>And give them the best technology and<br>environment for learning and best physical health.</p><p>You think humans will be happy. Unfortunately not!<br>Because there was almost no investment<br>on making humans reasonable, sensible, and respectful to others.<br>There is not enough sincere investment<br>in teaching human about<br>how to manage emotions, lust, temptation, greed, and anger.</p><p>No matter what book they read<br>some are violent all the time<br>Some are waiting for little provocation<br>So how to handle human society in this situation?</p><p>Is it possible to make human society sensible<br>and sensitive without religion?</p><p>Can technology and science do that for humans?<br>If no then why we are so much against the religion?</p><p>Yes, religion has caused many problems<br>in human society<br>but why don’t we understand<br>we reached to 21 century because of religion.</p><p>The problem is not in religion<br>This is an old tool to control and rule<br>This always will remain.</p><p>The problem is we don’t have the courage<br>to reject those old books of religion<br>and create a new book of love and respect for all.</p><p>A thinker like Kabira & Basavanna come and go<br>But follower create another religion<br>from the teachings of their masters<br>And society again has different levels of conflicts.</p><p>The problem is people think old is gold<br>Mine is the oldest, my people told it long back, they were wise.</p><p>We need to understand the question is not about<br>my people or their people<br>Neither the question is about<br>who said what and when.</p><p>The Question is can human keep aside something,<br>which is not making sense for the well being of human,<br>other lives around, environmental and mother earth.</p><p>The question is can human think again, look forward<br>Live with his senses and sensibly<br>Live with his experience<br>Do not live in a false paradise that I know<br>my people know, my ancestor knew everything.<br>But question everything around in a respectful way.</p><p>O Pratibimba! Is this too much expectation<br>From the human of this planet,<br>That she/he keep aside all this morality,<br>commandments and religion<br>and live like human?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat</p><p>Your Truly

class=td-heading-self-link href=#24-gurus-of-dattatreya aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Namaste</p><p>As per the Bhartiya wisdom stories Dattatrey is a son of Sage Attri & Mother Anusuya. Dattatreya is considered as one of the powerful Devata in our society. As per the stories he had 24 Gurus from nature. These Gurus have taught him the different aspects of life and living. Let’s see who are these Gurus of Dattatrey Maharaj and what are they teaching us. This is a <strong>big story</strong> and part of the eleventh Skanda of Bhagwatam. If you have time and want to enjoy the original full text then I would highly recommend you to read or listen to audio on this. In the interest of time, I am summarizing below the 24 Gurus of Dattatreya</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Water</strong> (Jal): Always flows towards down and rest on the lowest point. If you want to settle in life then high is not the place but the lowest is the place. If you are a seeker of knowledge then that is always the place where people can shower their knowledge upon you.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Earth</strong> (Prithvi). Forgiveness and patience. Continuously move. Everything for others.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sky</strong> (Akash). Rain, Fire, Air which are required for agriculture and producing grain comes from Akash. But Akash never claims on any of the produce. Live like Akash. Another property of the Akash is, it can never be contaminated.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Air</strong> (Prana Vaayu). We need little air to survive. We cannot take that more than our lungs capacity. Be content with small do not try to hoard, if you hold air for longer you will die. Secondly, when air is in control it is good when it is out of control, it becomes a cyclone. So, learn the importance of control from the air. We should have control over tongue, food, taste. Live a self-controlled life. Otherwise, it is a disaster for yourself and others. Outside Vaayu goes to all the places but does not get stuck in one place. So, keep moving in life.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Fire</strong> (Agni). The heat of the fire cannot be suppressed. It is an integral part of a fire. Fire consumes everything but doesn’t hold anything. Fire is present in wood always and sometimes comes out but when comes out it burns the same wood where it was resting. Uncontrolled anger in our life is like that.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sun</strong> (Surya). Attracts water and finally throw that completely back to the earth. Similarly, noble people attract so many things but they never get attached or entangled to any.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Moon</strong> (Chandra). Based on the movement of the moon, it looks of different shape and sometimes completely disappears but, in reality, Moon is always complete. Its fullness is not affected by what we see. Atma in the body is complete, no matter whether we see it or not.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ocean</strong> (Samudra). The deeper ocean is always silent. No matter how much is the rain, it never crosses the boundary.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Body</strong> (Sharir). Body and pain both are related. As long as a body remains there are chances of pain occurring in life for you and others around. There is no hope that you have a body and never pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Sense Organs</strong> (Gyanendriya): Object attracts sense organs, the mind gets pulled because of sense organs, body part moves because of desires of mind to catch the objects around. So, till the time sense organs are not restrained and the mind is not trained there is no hope for happiness in life.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Python</strong> (Ajgar). If survival is the only goal, then Python does not move much from his place and all the food comes to him and he survives for many years. Not much effort is required for survival. So don’t waste your life just running for survival. Have some meaningful goals and work for that.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Elephant</strong> (Haathi). An elephant is so powerful that it cannot be controlled easily by humans. But just by showing one she-elephant, a mighty elephant can be captured without much effort. No matter how powerful you are, if you have some weakness then that is good enough for making you a slave.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Dear</strong> (Hiran). A musk deer keep running in the whole forest in the search of that smell that is coming from its own musk. A desire for enjoyment that is coming from our own mind keeps us running our whole life until we know the source of joy is inside like musk in the dear.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Pigeon</strong> (Kabootar). Excessive love or hate is the cause of pain and self-destruction. We need to learn when to let things go away.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Fish</strong> (Machali). No matter whether it is small fish or big fish, when they jump on the food and hook is inside their mouth they cannot run away. This way they become the food of others. Be careful when you choose your food, business, prospect. If you are careless then there are high chances that very soon you will become the food of others.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Bumble Bee</strong> (Bhavara). To takes its food, it goes to all kinds of flowers and does not suck the juices of only one flower. A saint or sadhu should not trouble only one place or village for his food. Keep moving, this way he will help society in many ways.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Honey Bee</strong> (Madhumakhi). Honey is accumulated by a honeybee by their hard work, but it is enjoyed by somebody else. So do not waste your energy in the accumulation of excess.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Kite fly</strong> (Patanga). Death of the kite fly happens when it falls in love with fire. It loves that fire so much that finally, it jumps into it. Therefore understand, in the longer run, excessive attraction to the opposite sex will cause you grief and nothing much.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Crow</strong> (Kurur Pakshi). A crow hold meat in his beak is flying speedily and an eagle follows him. A crow thinks that the eagle is his enemy and keeps flying with more and more speed till the time when he cries for help and meat piece fall on the ground and eagle run away. Then crow realizes I was not the enemy but this eagle had eyes on my food. Sometimes when you feel the entire world is after you then let things go. You will come to know everything is fine.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Spider</strong> (Makadi). Create its own web, travels in that, and finally consumes it. The creator creates the world in the same way, lives in it, and consumes it by his own illusionary powers.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Honey Extractor</strong> (Madhuha). No matter how many honey bee hive around in the forest, Madhuha goes and takes only that much which is required for his need. He doesn’t accumulate that which is not the need of the day.</p></li><li><p><strong>An Arrow Maker</strong> (Baan Banena Wala). If your attention on your work is supreme then that engrossment is enough to forget the entire world around you.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Girl</strong> (Kanya). When there is a single bangle in the hand no matter what work she does it does not make any noise. If you want to live a life that is free of conflict and fight then the only way is to live alone.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Small Boy</strong> (Balak): Without bothering about their ego, they will fight and within a few minutes they will start playing together again.</p></li></ol><p>Hari Om Tat Sat</p><p>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5054--location-of-mind>Article5054 : Location Of Mind<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5054--location-of-mind aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Concepts, Death, Mind, Science]</p><h2 id=where-is-the-human-mind-located>Where is the human mind located?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#where-is-the-human-mind-located aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Today I am using this space to provoke you to ask subtler questions and know the answer from your experience. There is no answer below but many questions for you. Enjoy reading.</p><p>Namaste</p><p>We talk so much about the mind<br>But can you locate your mind in your body?<br>Don’t point your finger towards your head<br>That is the location of another<br>the physical part of your body called the brain</p><p>The brain is another hardware in our body<br>like heart, kidney, eyes etc.<br>Nothing special to hold the mind in it.</p><p>So, the puzzle is this.<br>Where is our mind located?<br>What are the functions of the mind?<br>Is it possible to see the mind,<br>Or it is like a ghost, unseen,<br>And known only through its Karma?</p><p>Observe the physical phenomenon world around<br>Solidity is the epitome of physicality<br>Mark the order of solidity for following<br>Food on a plate, water in a glass,<br>Cotton on a cotton flower,<br>The air around you, ideas in your mind,<br>Restlessness in your body<br>Unrest in society, Laugh of children<br>Cry of a helpless being, your feeling of love, hate, etc.<br>Your desire to win, to create, to enjoy<br>Social injustice around you.</p><p>What is the nature of that<br>which shakes the human heart<br>which keeps human in action<br>which keep human running<br>Is that Physical or non-physical?</p><p>A physical is that<br>Which can be located<br>Which can be measured<br>Can be created, destroyed, and converted<br>Can be displaced<br>Can change the form and the state.<br>Thus matter is physical.</p><p>Energy is nothing but less density matter<br>The same energy when condensate<br>Takes different states of physical existence around</p><p>They say mind does not matter<br>But can we say the mind is not a matter?</p><p>Post-death, when the rental body is given back<br>to the owner of the body, the Mother earth<br>Then they say mind transports to another body<br>Dharmic traditions called this rebirth.</p><p>Atma is eternally free and pure<br>What is that which you want to purify<br>by your actions of different types?</p><p>What is that part of your body<br>which does not have memories?<br>even your skin has memories<br>that is the reason your skin color is like what it is.</p><p>In the poetical world, it is good to express that<br>The mind thinks and the heart feels<br>But in reality, is that true?<br>Think again, what is special in the heart<br>for which you give it the responsibility of feeling?<br>The heart is another physical part of the body like brain.<br>There is no comparison between<br>a physical and another,<br>which is not solidly as physical.</p><p>What is the resting place of our<br>hope, emotion, creativity, dreams?<br>Is this just another form of chemical energy?<br>If so, then why don’t we create<br>the best chemical energy for our joy<br>rather than running around the world for our joy?</p><p>What is conciseness?<br>Consciousness is the effect of the physical lives around<br>or Consciousness is the cause of entire physical creation?<br>Including the physical space and time.</p><p>What is awareness?<br>Awareness is a cause or effect of consciousness?<br>Is awareness possible in an unconscious being?<br>Is a conscious being always aware of the surroundings?</p><p>Oh Pratibimba,

be done as some percentage of their profit.<br>But, even when you are not able to make the profit<br>Go out and express a sense of gratitude<br>for the ecosystem around.</p><p>When your employees go

Meditation Perspective Of A Practitioner<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5058--meditation-perspective-of-a-practitioner aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Concepts, Mindfulness, Yoga]</p><p>Namaste</p><p>An English word Meditation has many meanings<br>Today I sharing my perceptive on a Samskrut word Dhyanam,<br>which is an integral part of Indian yogic traditions.</p><p>Meditation is a process.<br>We know any process has input, activities, and output.</p><p>The duration of this process can be as short a 12 seconds.<br>With this duration, we call it Dharana or concentration.<br>The duration of Medication can be as large as life itself.</p><p>The larger is the duration more is awareness.<br>When the duration is large, the final output doesn’t matter.<br>Because every moment you pass in that state<br>a transformation is happening in you.<br>This is the state of oneness.</p><p>The degree of oneness depends upon<br>the intensity of your meditation, your nature,<br>and the framework being used.<br>In that state, breaking the meditation<br>and coming out to receive the benefits is not wise.</p><p>Is output wonderful?<br>The answer for that is you need to jump in<br>the water to know the joy of swimming.<br>Don’t ask it others.</p><p>This is a process of awareness<br>This is a process of dissolving your physical identity.<br>This is a process of identifying yourself as nonphysical.<br>This is a process of identifying yourself with the creator.</p><p>This is a process of disassociation<br>yourself from the entities and events around.<br>This is a process of dissolving<br>all named relationships.<br>This is a process of owning<br>only one relationship with the world around.<br>The relation of a mother.<br>Knowing that I am conceiver and deliverer<br>of the phenomenon world around.</p><p>Now, let’s see the inputs of this process<br>To enter into a meditative state,<br>when this process effortlessly happens in you<br>you need some preparation.<br>This preparation prepares<br>quality input for the process.</p><p>Thus input should be clean, pure, and pious<br>What does it mean?<br>This means the body and the mind<br>with which you want to perform this process<br>Should be stable, healthy, and clean.</p><p>Any pain in the body, and desire<br>of good or bad in the mind,<br>any emotional and sensational<br>disturbance in mind<br>will toxify the input.</p><p>Garbage in garbage out<br>is the principle of process engineering.</p><p>Like a copper pot, the more you clean more it shines,<br>An extremely dirty pot<br>if you clean for two minutes it will be clean.</p><p>But it will not be as clean<br>as it becomes after your rub it for ten minutes.<br>If you use lemon or tamarind it will be cleaner.<br>This way more time you spend to clean,<br>and the higher quality material you use<br>to clean more cleaner will be the copper pot.</p><p>More cleaner the pot<br>For more duration, you can use it<br>for your rituals without cleaning again.</p><p>A healthy mind and body is like that<br>We know it will never be the perfect<br>But our efforts to keep the input clean<br>and healthy will impact the process and its outcome.</p><p>After input, let us now see activities.<br>Activities depend upon a method<br>or a framework or a system or traditions you choose.<br>You can customize these methods<br>based on your need and nature<br>But the overall architecture of one system remains the same.</p><p>Vipassana, Shambhavi, Shoonya,<br>Kundalini, Zen, Transcendental, etc<br>are a few examples of the frameworks.<br>A framework may emphasize more on breathing<br>Or sensation or imagination or sound<br>or taste or smell or Akasa or an object<br>or combination of these.</p><p>Some framework gives importance to the place,<br>environment, body motions, and movements of eyes.<br>But all emphasize on the presence of mind<br>in present and awareness.</p><p>Because of other life priorities,<br>if you have to exit the process<br>and move into either daily mundane activities<br>or challenging activities<br>the impact of a few minutes of intense meditation<br>remains with you a whole day.</p><p>How long it will remain<br>it depends upon how intense was your meditation,<br>what kind of activities you do a whole day,<br>what environment you live in.<br>what are your food and drink habits?</p><p>If you avoid doing this process<br>to gain some power,<br>which can be used<br>for your physical enjoyment<br>then it will give you better results.</p><p>If you do this process<br>to learn how to be a witness<br>of all the phenomenon world around<br>be it creation or destruction,<br>be it birth or death,<br>be it make or break,<br>be it loss or profit,<br>be it coming and going<br>then more you will be blessed by this process.</p><p>Don’t do this process with any expectation<br>(productivity, peace of mind, good relationship etc)<br>Don’t do this process for any gain of future<br>Don’t do this process for pleasing or showing others<br>Even if you are doing it before your Deity, don’t do it for the Deity.<br>Don’t do this process for acquiring occult powers.</p><p>Do this process, out of love and respect<br>As this is the best biggest things<br>which our ancestors could give to us<br>Do this process to live in the present<br>for a few moments of the day.</p><p>Results need not be seen and praised by others<br>The result need not be explained to others<br>But results will transform the way you see<br>Life around, relationship, work,<br>gain-loss, pain-pleasure around.</p><p>O Pratibimba, could I inspire you<br>for experiencing this wonderful gift<br>which is available only for humans?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly

you.</p><p>Forgiveness is not forgetfulness.<br>Forgetfulness happens in unconscious living.<br>Forgiveness is possible only when you live a conscious life.</p><p>It doesn’t mean you are weak.<br>Neither it mean that you are strong<br>and powerful to forgive others.</p><p>It means you want to reject worries.<br>It means you want to reject bitterness.<br>It means you want to reject thinking in the past and future<br>It means you want to reject hurtful constantly thinking<br>about one event or a person or community.</p><p>It means you are not interested in getting stuck in cyclical life.<br>It means you want to move ahead in life.</p><p>It means you are choosing life.<br>It means you are choosing a present.<br>It means you are choosing progression<br>And rejecting regression.</p><p>It means you believe in the law of karma,<br>And you believe there is no real forgive in the existence.<br>It means you believe existence will settle things automatically,<br>And my actions can make things worse in life.</p><p>It means your reaction will cause a chain of karma<br>And I want to exit from that chain.</p><p>So forgiveness is your choice in wisdom and awareness<br>Do not give it poetical expression<br>and writing sweet quotes and poems on it.</p><p>Don’t assume that you need to have the strength to forgive.<br>What exactly you need is wisdom.<br>A pearl of wisdom which unfolds the future of regrets<br>in the present and tells you<br>that don’t choose death over life.</p><p>O Pratibimba, when forgiveness takes us away from death<br>and give us a fresh new breeze of life<br>then why it is so hard to forgive?<br>Are people more interested in dying?<br>or they are not wise enough to choose forgiveness?<br>or they are completely unaware of the consequence of not forgiving?<br>or they think that who will teach if I forgive?<br>or they think it is a sign of weakness?</p><p>or they foolishly see life in every moment of dying?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Your

think and do?</p><p>Why use dos and don’ts of religion?<br>Why use heaven and hell of religion to bring humans to senses?</p><p>Is there any relationship between religion and democracy?</p><p>Religion wants to control either through ruler or priest.</p><p>The democratic system gives freedom<br>to think, eat, worship, earn, spend, etc to all its citizens.</p><p>In non-democratic societies<br>a group of powerful people thinks<br>on behalf of their society.</p><p>Democracy has many assumptions.<br>The first assumption is<br>All citizens are matured enough to make<br>their decisions for themselves.<br>Is this assumption valid?</p><p>The second assumption is<br>Any decision of one citizen<br>does bring joy and problem only for oneself<br>So let them do whatever required for their own happiness.<br>But does it happens?</p><p>But the same democracy doesn’t allow<br>citizens to do suicide, rob and cheat others,<br>Democracy of a citizen ends<br>where the democracy of other citizen starts.</p><p>So we have overlapping boundaries<br>Which I enjoy, you don’t like,<br>Which you enjoy, I don’t like.</p><p>So, how to settle in these situations.<br>Either in public or private life<br>People still chose that age-old tricks<br>Exercise the power to force others.<br>Power may be of position or senior relations<br>or age seniority or money or muscles.</p><p>But, in a democracy the tool to settle the issues<br>is not any weapon or force or thrashing<br>The tool is to open your mouth, discuss, debate, and defend.</p><p>Unfortunately all people<br>do not have some patience<br>and skills to articulate, debate, argue<br>Thus they chose either to remain silent or fight physically.<br>Both are not good for democracy.</p><p>The third assumption in a democracy is<br>the citizens are educated<br>and can speak effectively on their behalf<br>or can hire someone easily who can speak on their behalf.<br>But, is this true? Is it easy?</p><p>The fourth assumption is democracy is<br>Once you are 18 years old<br>then you are a citizen of the country<br>Now, you have become mature enough<br>to think for yourself and make your own decision.<br>But does it happens?<br>Is our education system<br>and social structure makes us matured<br>by the time we reach 18?<br>Can we really think<br>what is good and whatnot for us?</p><p>Democratic laws give freedom but put a rider<br>If someone misuses that freedom to harm others,<br>nation, society, etc then there is a punishment.<br>But what is the definition of “misuse”?</p><p>Law is taking away that freedom,<br>to create your own definition of “misuse”<br>Courtroom debates decide what is “misuse”.</p><p>Interestingly, either the exerciser of the freedom<br>is ignorant or behave like that<br>but in reality, there is<br>no “real absolute freedom” as per the law.</p><p>This freedom is available only to those<br>who chose to live wisely<br>whether a constitution exists or not.</p><p>Because a democratic constitution<br>is an unwritten law in nature<br>“live and let others live”</p><p>Crooked want to interpret that<br>as per their whims and fancy<br>And suppress others.</p><p>Sometimes using the democratic laws<br>they are successful in doing so.</p><p>That is why in Hindu traditions<br>we consider Dharma is over the Law.<br>People can manipulate the law of the land<br>and get a favorable decision for themselves<br>But, the Dharma brings justice for all.</p><p>So there are riders for Freedom<br>And freedom is available in a democracy<br>But you fail to get freedom either<br>because someone crooked you or<br>you were too weak or too fragile<br>to protect yourself then Dharma delivers that justice.</p><p>O

feet, brain, etc.<br>and all parts put together make a complete system.</p><p>The system automatically consumes<br>the necessary things from the surrounding<br>without much efforts<br>like air, water, etc<br>provided they are available<br>in good quality and quantity<br>else system and in turn life need to struggle.</p><p>If struggle fails then the system collapses<br>and living body die.<br>This

is different<br>in a plant, it is a leaf, fruits, flowers, etc.<br>in the animal being it is milk, urine, poo, sweat, nails, hair, etc.</p><p>Nature has made a system in such a way that<br>every

illogical.<br>Even if enough is available he wants<br>to have more for tomorrow<br>not only for him but for his own people<br>not only for one or two days survival<br>but for the time till he dies<br>And he thinks he will never die<br>So keep in the go-down<br>as much as possible</p><p>So they turn houses into go-down<br>Without realizing that if they die tomorrow<br>There is not container service available<br>for the place where they go after death.</p><p>Human does not fight only for body survival<br>but the survival of his ideas and thoughts post his death.</p><p>A human fights for the ideas<br>of somebody whom he likes<br>i.e. Communist and leftist<br>people fight for the ideals of Karl Marks<br>and Gandhian people fight<br>for the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p>Human fights for his group.<br>A human fights for the dominance over others.<br>Human fights for proving himself right.</p><p>Human creates something for peace and harmony<br>and if somebody disturbs that<br>then human fights for that also<br>i.e human fights for religion.<br>Basically, religion is a system for peace and harmony.<br>But a human fight for that as well.</p><p>A Human fights for his taste.<br>If he like the taste of something<br>then whether it is live or dead<br>must be served on his plate for his enjoyment.</p><p>To survive every living needs some input.<br>If that is not easily available then<br>life fights with the other lives in nature.</p><p>Look it from the human perspective<br>when we fight we get mental and physical exertion<br>and with whom we fight the same happens to that as well.</p><p>Let us assume for sometime<br>you are living in a far village<br>In that village, there is only one home<br>and you are alone in that home</p><p>Today you are feeling hungry<br>you want something and nothing is available around<br>so you need to struggle.</p><p>You enter into a forest next to the village<br>and you find a dead goat; running chicken;<br>freshly fallen fruits from the tree; other hanging fruits,</p><p>Ask yourself what will you do<br>and what will you eat?<br>Fallen fruit or hanging fruit or<br>catch the running chicken or cook the dead goat.<br>It will help you understanding<br>how violent you are on a day to basis.</p><p>This is not a question of religion<br>This is not a question of survival<br>When enough is available then<br>what we prefer to eat is a matter of taste!</p><p>Every living being does violence for the survival<br>Eating a fallen fruit is one kind of violence<br>Plucking the fruit from the tree is another kind of violence<br>Eating a dead goat is one kind of violence<br>Eating a running chicken is another kind of violence</p><p>The highest degree of violence is where<br>eater and eaten both fights<br>for survival and both are emotional beings.</p><p>Ask yourself in nature<br>Whatever input you are consuming<br>is made for your survival or<br>some other kind of life is entitled to that.</p><p>The biggest problem is<br>human thinks life on the earth<br>is made by the god for him.<br>So if we do not enjoy then who will enjoy it.<br>The thought that this phenomenal world is human-centric<br>is the disease of the human mind.<br>And this is the cause of high violence.</p><p>Oh Pratibimba, it is possible to cure this disease by compassion?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Your Truly Hari</p><h1

Buddhist, Jain) and<br>Rama was our ancestor or<br>there is some more reason for that?</p><p>Perhaps Rama of Ayodhya has come back,<br>and Bharat and Ayodhya have many reasons to celebrate.<br>But see around in evening parties of Deepawali<br>who is celebrating Rama’s return and<br>how they celebrate that.</p><p>Hope Ravana has not compromised<br>the occasion and celebrating in an unethical way.<br>The day Osama Bin Laden celebrates American independence day<br>don’t think it is a good sign for the USA.<br>Be watchful in your breath about the celebrator<br>and the reason for the celebration.</p><p>Finally, my Rama has come back<br>but the Rama, which was in me<br>is still wandering in the forest,<br>when will he come back,<br>for what He is waiting?<br>On this auspicious

will I do now? Massacre!<br>Which was better? Nipping when it was bud or doing massacre now?</p><p>But why I need to do a massacre?<br>Either because of my lethargy<br>or because of morality principle<br>or because I thought it is too small to

cleaning or massacre<br>Are the only two option to survive<br>even in your own house.<br>The question is who will do this?<br>Either you do it yourself or<br>some of your family members does it<br>Or you outsource this to somebody.</p><p>But we need to understand one thing<br>One who is doing cleaning this work is favoring you<br>You cannot claim yourself a great disciple<br>of Mahatma Gandhi or Mahatma Buddha or Mahavira Jain<br>And say, Ahimsa Parmodharmah (Non-violence is the absolute principle)<br>Nor you have the right to abuse or downgrade the cleaner.</p><p>The same logic can be extended to a society<br>When you because lazy, careless or<br>try to become the epitome of non-violence<br>Then you cause more harm to a society<br>You need to be cautious and<br>from time to time clean the society<br>from unhealthy ideas, thoughts, dogmas,<br>hypocrisies, hardcore ideologies, thought of dominance.<br>To keep the society alive and vibrant<br>either the forces (police, military, etc) need to work<br>Or you need to work.<br>So that weeds can be kept out.</p><p>In a democratic society, it is expected that<br>We remain awake all the time<br>And kill the unhealthy ideas when they are bud<br>Or outsource this work to forces<br>But if no one does this then<br>Your own home will become a shelter<br>for terrorist, antisocial elements,<br>anti-national, Lawless, and Adharmic people.</p><p>The principle of non-violence applies to friendly elements<br>And it is not absolute<br>You cannot apply to terrorist, anti-national, robbers<br>It simply means do not allow weeds to grow around.</p><p>O Pratibimba, do you think it is easy to identify<br>which ideas should be killed?<br>If a house will belong to snakes<br>then ideas of Human has to be killed<br>And if the house belongs to human<br>then ideas of snakes have to be killed.</p><p>But in a democratic society<br>who decides who snake and who is human?<br>One who spills venom is a snake!</p><p>Venom doesn’t kill the snake.<br>But others suffer from it.<br>We know snakes and humans both<br>are suffering in society.<br>You decide who is a snake and who is human.<br>And then take action to clean your house<br>So

Translation<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5101--nuisance-of-translation aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Concepts, Education, Poetry]</p><p>My name is Hari Prasad and I like two food items Rasam and Idly.</p><p>If foreigners don’t understand or cannot pronounce what is the meaning of the above sentence then you can do the translation for them. So translation is “Green Food likes two kinds of food items the first item is made of pulses after removing pulse and leaving spicy water and the second item is made of grind rice paste cooked at steam and it is disk-shaped”.</p><p>The situation becomes too bad in Japan, China, and Korea where people cannot even pronounce Indian name and they use Chinese or Japanese equivalent.</p><p>And we think by doing the above translation we have conveyed that idea and they have understood. But the whole translation is wrong and they will never understand till the time they have experience with Indian culture. Because we don’t know their language and they don’t know our language so we chose a common language like English for communication.</p><p>We need to understand there are many non-translatable in every language and you cannot translate them using one-word replacement with another language.</p><p>Verbs like Eat, Drink, Walk are common verbs across the world so you can translate them from one language to another. Nouns like Table, Floor, Mango, Apple are common nouns so you can translate them also in another language.</p><p>Words that represent a big process or outcome of a complicated process or pure philosophical or abstract cannot be translated. In the initial stage, we try to translate so that other people can understand the basics of our culture, traditions, and philosophy.</p><p>Some Non-translatable words which do not have any equivalent in the English language are mentioned below. My suggestion is when you are talking to some Indian person please do not confuse them by doing translation until they don’t have any idea of these terms. Almost all Indian people understand the meaning of these. Unfortunately, many English-speaking people including Gurus and Acharaya do translate these words. My second request is when you are talking to a non-Indian person then try to use the original word and explain to them the meaning and don’t give a one-word substitution. Otherwise, you are diluting the Atma of the word. I know it is painful to explain especially when lots of one-word substitution has been created by many English-speaking Acharya of modern time but still try to understand that by doing so you confuse others, dilute the meaning and demean your own culture.</p><p>In the 19th and 20th century when our great Acharyas were doing this translation that time situation was completely different and nobody was listening to us so this translation was necessary. Today when Indians are everywhere and lots of investment is happening or already happened in translating, understanding our ancient scripture this translation is not required. In fact many of these words like Atma, Guru, Karma, Yoga, Pandita has taken place in the English dictionary. In that situation, it is our duty to spend time and try to understand the deeper and correct meaning of Samskrut Non-Translatable words and communicate them as they exist.</p><ol><li>Yagnya</li><li>Karma</li><li>Kaama</li><li>Moksha</li><li>Yoga</li><li>Bhoota</li><li>Prana</li><li>Samadhi</li><li>Dhyana</li><li>Samskara</li><li>Manas</li><li>Chitta</li><li>Darshana</li><li>Vishaya</li><li>Purusha</li><li>Ananda</li><li>Shraddha</li><li>Pragyna</li><li>Klesha</li><li>Kaala</li><li>Pranava</li><li>Upvaas</li><li>Vruta</li><li>Chaitnya</li><li>Rutambhara</li><li>Tatava</li><li>Pranidhyana</li><li>Avidhya</li><li>Maya</li><li>Karma Fala</li><li>Rastra</li><li>Viveka</li><li>Sanyasa</li><li>Rushi</li><li>Jeeva</li><li>Satchitananda</li><li>Devta</li><li>Ishwara</li><li>Bhagwaan</li><li>Brahman</li><li>Kundalini</li><li>Shakti</li><li>Chetna</li><li>Prakurti</li><li>Guna</li><li>Jaati</li><li>Mantra</li><li>Shuyna</li><li>Guru</li><li>Prakash</li><li>Pandita</li><li>Kaivalya</li><li>Nirvaan</li><li>MantraDrusta</li><li>Akshara</li><li>Sindoor</li><li>Udageeta</li><li>Upanishad</li><li>Punyam</li><li>Paapam</li><li>Satya</li><li>Linga</li><li>Bhava</li><li>Rasa</li><li>Adhyatma</li><li>Prasadam</li><li>Tarpana</li></ol><p>Shri Rajiv Malhotra’s Book <a href=https://beingdifferentbook.com/>Being Different</a> helped me to understand this nuisance of our culture and I have written this from his inspiration.

Police caught him and presented in court and the court sentenced him to be hanged on a certain date. Police personnel taking the person to be hanged. This person can run away and there are not many police people so that policeman wraps that person in some plastic and binds him tightly so that he cannot run away before he is taken to jail for hanging.</p><p>I meet this police head constable on the road he tells me the above story briefly. And then handover that body to me along with the court order copy. And tells me please ensure this person is hanged by this time. Otherwise, you and I both will be in trouble. And that police person disappears from the scene.</p><p>Now I am feeling a sense of duty to finish this task. I take this criminal bound in polythene wrapper, in my left arm. I am not feeling any weight from this person. I start traveling towards the place where an authorized person can hang the criminal. I don’t know the place. So searching for this place in the city.</p><p>I realized I am in Pondicherry and people are not understanding my language so I need to communicate in English. But all people don’t know English. There are many people who can understand French and Tamil. But, I don’t know French that much to communicate clearly. I am asking people where is the place where they hang criminals. They were guiding me to the place. Someone asked me why do you want to go there? I told this person in my hands need to be hanged this task has been given to me and here is the court order. That person asked me you are carrying this person packed in polythene for a long in your arms, is that person living? If he is not living then you want to hang a dead person? I said I don’t know. But after a few seconds, that person coughs from the polythene wrap to prove that he is living. But doesn’t make any other movement in the body. Lying in my arms live completely motionless. Not even breathing.</p><p>I was fed up on the road and it is summer late morning around 10 am in Pondicherry. People are not helping me and I am getting tired. Then I thought, let me take an auto-rickshaw and pay him for helping me. Whatever is the expense I will claim from govt because this is a government job.</p><p>I am looking for an auto and calling him for help. While the auto is coming to me and crossing the road, I am thinking who is the person in my hands? What crime he has done? Why he is so weightless? How can he remain unmoved without breathing and still living in my hands?</p><p>Now my dream breaks by the 5 am alarm on my phone. And for 90 minutes I am puzzled and finally writing this incident. What was the dream that which I saw or this where I am questioning? I don’t know.</p><p>I heard morning dreams are meaningful and they have an important message for us. It is a guidance of divine forces in advance. Probably universal cosmic power wants to make me prepared for something. I don’t know.</p><p>I don’t know whether good or bad is going to happen so anxiety is obvious. But after so many ups and downs in life, I started understanding that this waking state is also a dream state in human life.</p><p>We think that a state where we ask the more fundamental questions and validate the purpose of happening and incidents in life is a waking state but when we are in a dream state then those events and questions there are not any less real. Whatever we know and experience is our reality when we wake to another state of existence then previous reality looks unreal, illogical. Fight, desperation, struggle, enjoyment, people, relationships of that state, money, power, poverty all disappear as soon as the state changes.</p><p>In life we go through the three states everyday, waking, dream, and sleep. In whatever state we live in life is the reality until we are living there. Once we move to the next level of awareness then all past state actions, environments, the relationship looks lessor real, fake, and foolish act. The question is how long it takes for a person to move from one state of awareness to another state of awareness. Death is waking to another state of awareness. Every day when our older bodies and ideas die we wake up for new dimensions of life. The dead body gets dissolve into five primary elements of the body but awareness continues.</p><p>Life is that which has no relationship with death. “Life” is a noun, not a verb. When the living(verb) process is happening in a body then life (noun) moves to another place for living and the previous body falls.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1

from the same source.</p><p>After coming into existence<br>does drop have an identity?<br>Well, if not so then how can we say<br>that this is my water and that is your water?</p><p>You will say that I

desert,<br>burning stove, or flood it will die quickly.<br>In another environment, it can have a longer life.</p><p>And how a drop takes birth, live, and die?<br>A drop can know experimentally<br>that

the other part of the ocean’s surface.</p><p>And many times I join other<br>who are mourning my death from my past life<br>because they think “that” drop was the great drop.<br>So we should offer some flower to that<br>and remember the work that drop did.</p><p>Yoga was the way drop lived<br>Whether you sing or dance,<br>Cry or weep, laugh or smile<br>eat or drink, breath or blink<br>Create or destroy some other drops around<br>Every moment you are navigating<br>your life from one corner to another corner<br>on the surface of the ocean called consciousness.</p><p>Whether you do Bhakti yoga, sing, dance,<br>pray and praise your Lord.<br>Or you do Karma yoga, work without fatigue<br>and surrender all the results<br>of your action at the feet of your Lord.</p><p>Whether you do Hatha yoga,<br>control your physical and mental body at your will<br>Or you do Gnyana yoga,<br>know your true nature,<br>transcend the Maya around<br>and live the way like you are playing<br>on the ground because have time.</p><p>All are the ways of dissolving<br>your little drop to the cosmic ocean<br>And be one with the cosmos.</p><p>How long you will protect your drop<br>One day it merges to the ocean<br>from where it has come.<br>On this planet, that process is called death.</p><p>But if you do this consciously<br>and let it happen every day then<br>the same process of unification is called Yoga.</p><p>While sitting at a place we think<br>Only time is changing and the place is the same.<br>But on a planet that is moving<br>with 67,000 miles per hour around the sun<br>And rotating on its own axis<br>with 1000 miles per hours<br>It is foolish to say that we are staying<br>at the same place even after one hour.</p><p>The truth is we moved millions of miles away<br>in the sky, since the time we have taken birth.<br>But the drop never knows that and neither bother<br>because drop rises from the ocean<br>and fall back on the surface of the ocean.<br>And this is the only and limited experience of a drop.</p><p>Those who are counting Atma or soul<br>are counting drops on the surface of the ocean.<br>Without knowing the size of a drop!<br>Without realizing the depth of the ocean!<br>Without realizing that the ocean is also a drop in space!!</p><p>What is the way to know you are drop?<br>What is the way to know<br>you are a deer who have musk in your own body?</p><p>Nothing. Just stop running<br>and spend your time and energy knowing this.<br>But the real question is<br>what will happen even if you know you are a drop?<br>And the next question is,<br>why should I know, which I already know?</p><p>What Karna did even after knowing from Kunti<br>that her real mother is Kunti and not Radha?<br>That was the moment of realization<br>for Radheya that he is Kaunteya.</p><p>He still fought on behalf of Duryodhana<br>He still wanted to kill Arjuna<br>But we know fighting was not the same for Karna<br>something fundamentally has changed<br>in him after this realization.<br>That is the power of self-realization.</p><p>If you truly know that you are a drop<br>then something fundamentally will change in you<br>Perhaps your dissolving will not be painful.</p><p>Perhaps your reactions<br>to the surrounding will turn into the response.<br>A response that is appropriate<br>and need of the hour<br>But free from jealousy, anger,<br>competition, compulsion<br>and desire to demolish other drops.</p><p>Perhaps your madness for enjoying<br>every drop of your life juice will reduce.</p><p>Perhaps your madness to exploit<br>the planet and lives around will diminish.</p><p>Perhaps the way you talk<br>and think about others will alter.</p><p>Perhaps you will move beyond<br>grief, sorrow, happiness & joy<br>and enter into unconditional blissfulness.</p><p>O Chaitnya, you may be thinking<br>this all is mental imagination.<br>If so then the entire Vedanta is imagination<br>and your reality is much horrible without a solution.</p><p>Do you think millions of people<br>in Indian civilization spend thousands of years<br>and the best gave us is Vedanta<br>and that is just mental imagination?</p><p>Perhaps they knew what is good for

So, these people look serious and dry. Nothing enough flows from their life that others can receive. But is maths and physics really like that? The answer is a big no! Both are extremely beautiful in fact they can engross your mind much more than any music or dance can.

If one can do that activity successfully as per one’s satisfaction then one thinks he exercised his freedom to ‘think’ and to ‘do’.</p><p>Most of the time this so-called freedom is compulsiveness. It is coming from our deep-rooted behavior and condition mind. In nutshell called Svabhava.</p><p>How do you know it is freedom or compulsiveness? After performing an activity or after not able to perform an activity if you experience out of balance in your mind. Itchiness of mind is ‘oh yes, I have done it’ or ‘oh sad, I could not do that. If one is feeling too happy or too sad then it is was definitely one’s compulsiveness.</p><p>In the name of freedom, we are slaves of our senses, conditioned mind, and society/environment around us.</p><p>A human mind can develop a feature called Samatvam.

Views&rsquo;]</p><p>Food, sex, religion, and politics are four topics where everyone has his own experience, a perspective of looking into, and a view about.</p><p>Here I am putting My view about food. If you disagree with my views, then I would love to listen and learn more from every thinking man and woman.</p><p>Human is a thinking animal, a human can think, and it helps human to understand the environment better and adapt to the environment. Other than if we think a human is God created special life on this planet etc. that is all our personal belief. No one knows the truth, it is an internal debate, so better move to the topic of food.</p><p>Go into an open environment like a forest or park and watch insects, birds, reptiles, and animals. Look what they eat and how they survive. Do they struggle to choose between what to eat and what not? They know their food very well. How? Because of their design! The design of their intestine, mouth, teeth, tongue, etc. tells them what will help in surviving and what not. So they eat what is fit for them. You can this any technical name like nature, Swabhav, etc., but ultimately it is their design.</p><p>You will rarely see a non-vegetarian cow, goat, deer, etc. Likewise, you will rarely see a vegetarian lion, bear, leopard, etc. I am saying rarely because exceptions are there in nature and people can dig the hole even in sound logic. For that, what they need is an exception!</p><p>To survive, every life needs a balanced diet of vitamins, carbohydrates, fat, protein, etc. It is not that only humans need it. Ask yourself from where a pure vegetarian animal gets all these components for living a healthy life? Did you find a protein or vitamin deficit in cows, goats, or lions? If yes, then did you recommend them to keep on a different diet so that their deficiency problem can be addressed. Even before we have these high-tech English words, life on this planet is existing for many millennia.</p><p>Now the question is what is good for humans? The answer is in another question. Why human is struggling so much to determine this? Especially when every creature on the planet knows what to eat when to eat, how to eat. How come only human is confused?</p><p>I think the answer is we don’t observe enough and don’t think deeper. We are rational beings, so we use intellect to justify whatever we like or hate. Animals never had that luxury.</p><p>Look yourself in the mirror, ask yourself are your teeth, tongue, and mouth design anything like lion or cow. Is your intestine like a cow or lion? Herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores have different body designs.</p><p>Because of cultural reasons, we attach food to religion, but for a thinking person, food shouldn’t be a religious issue. You have taste buds for something, and you want to eat something. For that, we take the help of religion or science. People put the arguments of protein, vitamins, carbohydrates from science books without realizing that other creatures are also living a healthy life without reading diet charts. How come, only humans need to eat something which is not his or her design. When they put a daily diet chart of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins before me, I always laugh at that. I say you eat whatever you’re convinced of, don’t try to justify that with this western science’s balance dietary chart, after all, human has the intellect to justify everything.</p><p>Based on the food available around, humans had adapted themselves accordingly. There are still humans who eat raw animals and insects to survive because agriculture is possible only when there is civilization and culture. When agriculture evolved, the human design also changed over the period.</p><p>But humans still give that logic of balancing their diet by eating something which is coming from animals. Some are limited to milk and dairy items and some go to the extent of killing and eating animals. Some do this in the name of religion, some in the name of science.</p><p>Oh Pratibimba! Will human being ever obverse, think, and do?</p><p>Or always do and reason his or her desire, actions?</p><h1 id=article5132--choose-your-attitude>Article5132 : Choose Your Attitude<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5132--choose-your-attitude aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;My Views&rsquo;, Philosophy]</p><p>The world around us is either a warfield or playground.<br>If it is warfield then we keep fighting.<br>If it is a playground, then we keep playing.<br>If we are interested in doing karma then<br>these are two kinds of Karma options before us.<br>In one karma one gets exhausted and wants to quit,<br>in another one enjoys and wants to continue the game.</p><p>Apart from that if we assume we have some<br>God given goal, responsibility, purpose, etc.<br>that is our self owned extra material<br>it can help us fight or play better and with a different attitude.</p><p>Life is a struggle, fighting, and survival issue for those<br>who see the forest around and find themselves in the forest.<br>Life is play for those who find all are my friends around<br>there is no competition, there is no rival, there is no enemy.<br>There is a game, winning or losing is not important.<br>Play is important.<br>There is no enemy or rival,<br>but we have an opponent on the ground.<br>We need to play to keep the game interesting<br>and not for defeating or winning others.</p><p>In our playfulness, we harm lesser to the environment and ourselves.<br>While in a fight, we get injured and cause more injury,<br>irrespective of our fighting skills.<br>In Hinduism, we say Devas does Leela (play) and<br>Asura do yuddha (fight).<br>That is why we say Bhagwan ki Leela.<br>We never say Asuron ki Leela.<br>What attitude we choose for the world around us<br>and for life is 100% our choice.</p><p>Oh Chaitanya, just go and play<br>all are children of the same mother earth.<br>Some are crocked, some are nice.<br>But don’t spoil your game because of some bad player.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5133--equation-of-arjunas-arrows>Article5133 : Equation Of Arjunas Arrows<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5133--equation-of-arjunas-arrows aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;Indian Culture&rsquo;, &lsquo;Indian Sciences&rsquo;]</p><h2 id=arjunas-arrows-and-algebra-beejganit>Arjuna’s Arrows and Algebra (Beejganit)!<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#arjunas-arrows-and-algebra-beejganit aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Bhāskarāchārya (1114 -1185 CE), has been called the greatest mathematician of medieval India.

These teasers are in the form of shlokas which pose the problems. The shlokas need to be interpreted correctly to decipher the meaning in order to find the solution.</p><p>In the 70th Shloka of Leelavati, we see equations related to Arjuna’s Arrow.</p><p>पार्थ: कर्णवधाय मार्गणगणं क्रुद्धो रणे संदधे<br>तस्यार्धेन निवार्य तच्छरगणं मूलैश्चतुभिर्हयान् |<br>शल्यं षड्भिरथेषुभिस्त्रिभिरपि च्छत्रं ध्वजं कार्मुकम्<br>चिच्छेदास्य शिरः शरेण कति ते यानर्जुनः संदधे || 70 ||</p><p>The direct meaning of this shloka is a question formulated as follows:</p><p>During the battle between Arjuna and Karna in the Mahabharata, Arjuna released some arrows, out of the released arrows:</p><ul><li>Half were consumed in stopping the arrows coming from Karna.</li><li>4 times the square root of the arrows were consumed to control the horses of Karna’s chariot</li><li>Six were for gaining control over Shalya, the charioteer of Karna.

So how many arrows were released by Arjuna in the battle?</li></ul><p>If we formulate this equation correctly, then the basic algebra easily yields the answer to this question,</p><p>X = X/2 + 4√X + 6 + 3 + 1</p><p>Solving the above, we get the value of X=100 for the total number of arrows shot by Arjuna.</p><h1 id=article5134--universal-culture>Article5134 : Universal Culture<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5134--universal-culture aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Concepts, Education, &lsquo;Indian Culture&rsquo;]</p><p>All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, <strong>there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial</strong>, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.</p><p>Just think <strong>why do people, societies, and nations argue, fight and go to war?</strong> Not because of physical level differences. They enter there because of some reasons, and these reasons come from emotion. When you feel strongly about something, you want others to follow that. When someone attacks you, then you defend yourself. Not only defends, sometimes you crazily attack someone who does not have similar emotions as you. Sometimes these attacks are physical, sometimes emotional, and other times verbal.</p><p>But, <strong>what is at the root of emotion and feelings</strong>? Value system, principle, ideology are the seat of emotions. Humans are the construct of these. Our education system and upbringing alter this and have a huge influence on these. That is why when one civilization wants to win over another the hard method is war, but the soft method is to change the education system.</p><p>Culture is that concept which shapes individual human and human societies. But, <strong>what is culture</strong>? It has nothing to do with your physical differences or skin color. It is deeper. The language which you use to communicate, the agriculture, fruits you cultivate, the food you eat or serve are part of your culture. Your attitude towards your own relatives, friends, society is part of the culture. Your attitude towards other food and society etc. are components of your culture.</p><p>One of the key components of the culture, which I noticed prominently, is <strong>how you greet people</strong>. How do you greet your known and unknown? How do you greet elders, youngers, same age people and children? How do you greet known and unknown people of the opposite gender? If you are a little serious <strong>student of humanity, culture, and civilizational studies</strong> then you would notice how Japanese, Chinese, Arabs, Europeans, and Indians greet. All are complete differently and with different emotions.</p><p>Another extension of the greeting is the way you address other people. How do you address known people, unknown people, known/unknown people of the opposite gender, elders, parents, teachers, brothers, and sisters?</p><p>Broadly if you observe cultures around you will notice <strong>Western, Chinese, Japanese, Arab, and Indians have their own unique way of addressing.</strong> In Indian society, although we have many languages yet huge importance has been given to establish a relationship with a person before you address him. There are many unique names for each relation like Mata, Pita, Bhrata/Bhai, Bahin/Bhagini, Didi, Mitra, Sakha/Sakhi, Chacha, Chachi, Bua, Mama, Mami, Fufa, Fufi, Sasur, Sasu Maa, Dada, Dadi, Nana, Nani, Guru, Guru Maa, Bhabhi, Jija, etc. this list goes very long. Thus, when you address someone, we primarily address with these unique words assigned to relations. With this also, we give so much respect that we put the suffix “Ji” with every relation.</p><p><strong>Another extension to the greeting is the emotions</strong> that you have in your heart while addressing another person. These emotions are governed by our culture. Ram, Sita, and Laxman are gods for many people, but for many of the people, they are ideal of human life. <strong>There is not even one week difference between Ram’s and Laxman’s age</strong>, but still, Laxman refers to Sita Ji as his mother. Because in our culture it told that friend’s wife or elder brother’s wife should be treated as mother. Younger’s brother’s wife should be treated as a sister. Establish a relationship with the opposite gender so that you don’t become unknown and inaccessible to her/him. Maintain a relationship of mutual trust and respect.</p><p><strong>Recent excessive Westernization of Indian culture has finished all the relationships</strong> and all the emotions behind these relations. Now you have only 9 relations mom, dad, uncle, aunt, bro, sis, friend, grandpa, grandmom. We have killed all other relations and people even do not know those names. As westerners, we started calling all people around by their first name, without realizing their age, our relationship with them, their seniority, their gender, etc.</p><p>Now in Indian urban families, there are only 5 greetings methods namely hi, hello, good morning good afternoon, and good night. And without paying attention, people think it means the same as Namaste, Namaskar, Jai Siya Ram, Pranam, Pailagu, Dandvat Pranaam etc. Nowadays, people are so much confused that they don’t know what needs to be done when. So the easiest way is to say hi.</p><p><a href=../../wiaposts/the-meaning-of-namaste/>The meaning of Namaste</a></p><p>There are only two titles now, sir and madam. People don’t know how we were giving respect in our culture. Perhaps old people remember that if someone asks you your father, mother, or guru’s name you must put Shri, Shriman, or Shrimati before uttering their actual name. How people were addressing unknown people in the assembly of king or panchayat? Perhaps you forgot. Mahodaya, Shriman Ji, Shrimati Ji, Bandhu, Bhagini, Brata, Maharaj are just a few ways. People think sir and madam are easiest, and it is the same as our own culture.</p><p>If you understood my point, then what will you call this? Annihilation of culture? You couldn’t value your culture, so you couldn’t export it. You valued other’s cultures, and you imported that heavily. Now in the name of an educated family, cultured family what we see is the Homogenization of culture!</p><p>If you think that if our world has only one religion, one language, one culture, one currency, same wealth for all, same cloth for all, same food for all, same god for all then you are talking about the animal kingdom. All lions or cows or buffalo or deer or mouse looks the same in the forest.</p><p>I think culture is very important for humans without that he or she is an animal. But which culture? Can there be one universal culture? I think if someone has a dream of one culture, one rule for the whole of humanity, then that idea is most dangerous. It means cultural genocide of others.</p><p>So what is the solution? Know your culture, follow that, greet others as per their culture, and mutual respect for each other’s culture.</p><p>Do let me know your feedback about culture in the commentbox.</p><h1 id=article5135--value-based-true-friendship>Article5135 : Value Based True Friendship<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5135--value-based-true-friendship aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ &lsquo;Indian Culture&rsquo;, &lsquo;Motivational Stories&rsquo;]</p><h2 id=when-sir-mv-blackmailed-dvg>When Sir MV blackmailed DVG<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#when-sir-mv-blackmailed-dvg aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h2><p>Sir M Visvesvaraiah was the Dewan of the Mysore State from 1912 to 1918. Sir MV, as he was popularly known, had a fairly large circle of friends and among them was eminent Kannada writer and thinker D V Gundappa (DVG).</p><p>DVG was not merely a writer but was also a journalist, eminent thinker, and a visionary. In 1945, he set up the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs in NR Colony, Bangalore, and he was instrumental in beginning the Popular Education League and the Social Service League.</p><p>DVG was a close friend and associate of Sir MV. There were many times when Sir MV would either invite DVG over for discussions on State policies and other affairs of the Mysore State.</p><p>The discussions were helpful to Sir MV in taking decisions or coming up with a policy. Over time, the discussions became longer, took on a more serious note and the result led to the adoption of several radical changes in the State administration.</p><p>Ever the gentleman, Sir MV had no qualms about acknowledging the credit to DVG. This was in the mid 1920s and DVG was not in a very sound financial position. Yet, he neither sought favors nor accepted any from any person or organization.</p><p>It was then that Sir MV decided to do something to his friend. He first broached the idea of an allowance for DVG for “picking” his brains and helping the State come to a decision. A proud DVG outrightly refused.</p><p>DVG pointed out that the discussions were between friends, and they could not be measured in monetary terms. Moreover, he was a journalist, and he could not afford to take money from the Government, however benevolent it may be.</p><p>Sir MV then suggested that DVG could accept the appointment as a Consultant to the Mysore Government and in return, he would be paid a certain amount. DVG trashed the idea and steadfastly refused to reconsider his decision of not taking any amount from the Government.</p><p>DVG pointedly told Sir MV that he disliked the idea of taking money for discussing issues with his friend. Try as much as he could, Sir MV failed to budge DVG.</p><p>Sir MV then told DVG that, henceforth, their conversation would be limited only to family and personal matters and no other topic would be discussed. A reluctant DVG agreed, but soon he found himself starved of the intellectual companionship of Sir MV. It was now the turn of DVG to cajole Sir MV to get back to the scholarly interactions that had become so important part of their daily routine.</p><p>Sir MV then realized that he had DVG where he wanted. He promised to continue the serious and scholarly debates and discussions provided DVG became a consultant to the State. DVG agreed, and soon both were back to their scholarly best.</p><p>The regular discussions helped Sir MV formulate State policy and also in governance. He ensured that DVG would be paid for the discussions, and the then Mysore State Treasury (it was then called Huzur Treasury) issued cheques to DVG.</p><p>Sir MV passed away in 1962 and DVG in 1975. When a trunk belonging to DVG was opened shortly after his passing, there were several cheques issued from the Treasury that had been kept uncashed.</p><p>These were the cheques issued on the insistence of Sir MV but DVG had no intention of encashing them, he accepted them and kept them locked away in a trunk. The total amount in the cheques ran to lakhs.</p><p>Neither of these men was after money or fame. Yet, today, they are remembered by one and all. One is remembered for his engineering skills, the other is known for his “Mankutimmana-Kagga”, a rare piece of art in the otherwise dry world of literature.</p><p>Both the engineering skills of Sir MV and the Kagga of DVG have survived.</p><p>This is a great example of value-based true friendship. Even if one is serious about this kind of friendship, it is not easy to get this kind of partner friend. One needs grace to happen in one’s life.</p><h1 id=article5136--unanswered-questions-of-science>Article5136 : Unanswered Questions Of Science<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5136--unanswered-questions-of-science aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Science]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>I am a student of science and technology, apart from that I have a deep interest in philosophy and cosmology.

of their human nature<br>Following that, they knew their limitation, their emotion, and feeling<br>They became shy and covered their bodies.<br>This led to their sex life,<br>And because of sex, progeny happened.<br>And we humans are the creation of that.</p><p>Different people have different interpretations of this event.<br>But for any normal thinking human being,<br>It looks like an absurd idea.<br>Why having knowledge is sin?<br>Why are humans knowing their limitations is a sin?<br>If sex is a sin then entire humanity is the outcome of sin.<br>This way, Christianity gives very high importance to celibacy.</p><p>In Islam what is the biggest reward of following the Path of Allah?<br>You get eternal heaven<br>But why is heaven so interesting in Islam?<br>Because in heaven, each Momin gets 72 virgins!<br>But what will you do of 72 virgins?<br>Have sex for eternal life!<br>So sex is good in Islam<br>For this people do as many marriages as they can afford<br>People live for it and die for sex.</p><p>In Santana Dharma tradition like Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism<br>Celibacy or Brahmacharya is considered one of the highest Virtue<br>Patanjali yoga sutra says one of the five Yama is Brahamcharya<br>Without proper Yama and Niyama in place,<br>you cannot proceed on the Path of Yoga.<br>Eight sequential steps of Patanjali Ashtanga Yoga are<br>Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayam, Pratayahara,<br>Dharana, Dhyana, and finally Samadhi.</p><p>If you interpret it properly, then Patanjali is saying<br>Without Celibacy, you cannot move on the path of Yoga<br>Why? Because Yama means ethical life<br>The absence of ethical life Will cause you restlessness<br>Following that, you cannot do Asana<br>Pranayam without Asana is not effective<br>Dharana without Pranayam is not possible.<br>Dhyana without Dharana is impossible<br>Samadhi and self-realization without Dhyana are unthinkable.</p><p>But, if people are interested in both<br>self-realization and family life, then what to do?<br>Hindu Philosophical systems say<br>the purpose of marriage are many<br>One, to fulfill sexual desire<br>Two, to compliment two opposite energy channels of the<br>two bodies so that each individual becomes balance.<br>Three, have progeny so that society can survive<br>and the knowledge system continues<br>Four, build a healthy society with reliable relationships<br>where children’s physical and mental health is taken care of<br>Fifth, think beyond life, do good Karma, Yagnya together<br>so that you both reach heaven together<br>Sixth and final inspire each other for Moksha and Mukti.</p><p>Unfortunately, most people do not understand this properly<br>and they give so much importance to one or two aspects<br>of their married life that they don’t realize that<br>there is married life beyond sex and children.</p><p>But keeping that aside,<br>How a person who is interested in family life can have celibacy?<br>Which is one of the key components of Yoga and self-realization?</p><p>Have you seen the caves of Khajuraho?<br>That is the part of Sanatana Dharama.<br>Not only that, there are many temples around India<br>where you see these kinds of erotic postures<br>between a male and a female around the outside wall of the temple.<br>What is the message?<br>Sanatana Dharma is advocating do all<br>whatever sensual you feel is necessary for life.<br>After you are fully satisfied<br>When you feel there is nothing else to be done<br>then only go inside the temple with a calm mind.</p><p>You cannot mediate if you are thinking about sex.<br>Without meditation, Samadhi is impossible<br>and hence self-realization is unattainable.</p><p>People develop their own purpose of life and married life<br>And to fulfill that, they do whatever is required for them.<br>Sometimes they do it mutually and other times as alone.</p><p>In Hindu systems, we hear many stories of<br>Brahmacharya of Bhisma, Vishwamitra<br>Sri Ramachandra of Ayodhya, Lakshman,<br>Hanuman, Ramkrishna Paramhamsa, Vivekananda etc.<br>Some were married, some not.<br>Chose your ideal of life rightly,<br>and try to live up to them, you may have ups and downs in your life<br>but you will not feel succumbed to life.</p><p>In Hinduism unlike Christianity<br>Brahmacharya is not a binary concept that either you or not.<br>Here it is a gradual control of life forces.<br>There are people who chose lifetime Celibacy.<br>There are others who chose for one year or one month.<br>Ramchandra chose celibacy for fourteen years.<br>Whatever degree of celibacy you can practice in your life<br>that much control you can exercise on your physical and mental body.</p><p>The highest degree of Brahmacharya can lead to the highest virtuous life<br>It can protect one from physical aging and physical diseases,<br>It can protect one from disgrace and confusion.<br>It gives you intellectual, mental, and physical strength to live like a Jeevan Mukta.</p><p>It protects one from mental sickness, craziness,<br>It helps in culminating Bhakti and meditative mind.<br>It helps in developing strong resolute.<br>It frees one from the dual mind<br>It gives clarity in thinking.</p><p>In Sanatana Dharma Sex is neither virtue nor sin.<br>Celibacy doesn’t mean lifelong celibacy<br>Everything has some purpose in life.<br>Try to understand the purpose and move.<br>Don’t

Festival is an occasion to celebrate.<br>If the day is Vijaya Dashami<br>Then the day is to<br>Celebrate your success (Vijay)<br>Celebrate your journey<br>Celebrate your learning through a tough time<br>Otherwise, many people quit on the way.</p><p>Celebrate the success of your parents, Acharyas<br>Celebrate the success of your King and state<br>Celebrate the success of your Ideology, party, and people.</p><p>In India, people celebrate Vijay Dashami<br>Because this was the day when Ram killed Ravana,<br>The epitome of the Adharma of Rama’s time.</p><p>Some people celebrate this event as a symbol<br>Because they feel past win just reminds us<br>that we can still win over current adverse circumstances.<br>Some people celebrate as an annual affair<br>of some historic event which happened only once<br>and that win was the ultimate.</p><p>Whatever you think depends upon what you value.<br>But, before you go to win something,<br>Please make sure that you know yourself clearly.<br>Winning is not that important<br>Who is going to win whom is also important.<br>In an eternal fight between Daivik and Asuri shakti<br>sometimes Devta wins and sometimes Asura wins.</p><p>Your Asura may be someone’s Devta<br>Your Devata may be someone’s Asura<br>You may be Asura for someone and Devata for someone.<br>Many times we remain busy defining others and explaining ourselves.</p><p>Vijay Dashami is not only time to celebrate success<br>But also reflects who we are<br>What we really want to win over<br>Is it worth winning that<br>Maybe we are standing at the wrong side<br>like Vibhishan, then losing is more beneficial.</p><p>May be we are standing for a wrong cause<br>like Duryodhana so accepting and surrendering<br>before the war is also winning.<br>Winning always doesn’t need<br>the destruction of Kurushetra scale.<br>Sometimes it is just switching to Dharma.<br>But don’t be like politicians to switch<br>when you know Dharma is at your side<br>but in the current circumstances, you may lose.</p><p>Standing for Dharma is not easy<br>Neither it is easy to stand for Adharma<br>Generally, people get scared of circumstances and change the party.<br>But the beauty with Dharma is some universal force<br>will keep supporting you<br>and even if you are alone you will not feel so.</p><p>We recently have seen Taliban also won and they celebrated<br>Probably they will celebrate for some more years.<br>But, at what price?<br>What are they celebrating, win of Adharma?<br>Are they celebrating unjust to poor, weak, common citizens,<br>women, children, the crippling education system,<br>and friendship with the real enemy?</p><p>Rama’s win is celebrated even after thousands of years,<br>because it was not a personal fight only.<br>It was for Dharma, justice, pride of women.<br>It was a struggle to keep the words given at personal loss<br>It was not personal ego but<br>Demolishing hyped ego which was on the path of continuous destruction.</p><p>You think Rama is your own self<br>Sita is your own self.<br>Ram Rajya is your inner state and immediate surrounding.<br>Winning does not mean eating too much, shopping, party, and alcohol.<br>Winning simply means being<br>At absolute ease with your own people,<br>your surroundings, enjoying without indulgence.<br>Otherwise, it may be possible Ravana is celebrating Rama’s win.</p><p>O Praribimba, may you get the wisdom<br>to know the right path and wrong path<br>of your life journey with clarity.<br>May you decide your parties, partner, and friends with that clarity.<br>Some will join you and you will join some.<br>You will drop someone and someone will drop you.<br>May you fight a decisive fight of Dharma<br>May you win your fight, so that you can celebrate your own<br>Vijaya Dashami today and in the time to come.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5143--about-food-and-nourishment>Article5143 : About Food And Nourishment<a class=td-heading-self-link

living bodies embedded together<br>But superficially it looks one.<br>When it comes to nourishing, it is our responsibility to nourish all three.<br>Consuming food that nourishes the<br>Only one body and ignoring others is not wise.<br>If you do it willingly, then it is a type of slow suicide.</p><p>Since childhood, if you are focused on<br>The food of only one body then<br>You cannot experience<br>your own existence in the other two bodies.<br>Because it is almost dead or ignored so much<br>that no voice of nourishment need<br>reaches your current level of living.</p><p>The food of all three bodies is different.<br>Different foods are rich in different content and different nutrition,<br>so they nourish different bodies<br>with different degrees and different ways.</p><p>Those bodies are gross or physical or matter-body.<br>Emotional, intellectual, energy body.<br>And your causal body, which is supporting your two bodies,<br>cause of your beyond body existence,<br>beyond time and space body,<br>in quality, it is one with the universe.<br>Sanskrit text refers to it as JivaAtman.<br>In fact, it is not a body in a physical sense<br>Because it is beyond matter and energy.</p><p>Food can be grain, vegetables, milk, meat,<br>egg, fish, flesh from other life, or fruits.<br>It depends upon your culture and geography of living.</p><p>Food can be ideas which you get from others<br>while interacting or observing others.</p><p>Food can be internally generated emotions<br>when you feel for somebody or some cause or some event.<br>These emotions feed our energy body.</p><p>Food can be sweet, bitter, salt, sour, pungent in taste.<br>And even these six tastes can be in<br>the different degrees in the different food.<br>The sweetness of apple and sweetness of sugar<br>are different in quality and grade.<br>The sweetness of the emotions of hugging your child<br>and hugging your best friend is different in quality and grade.<br>The sweetness of feeling one with your God<br>and one with your life partner is different in quality and grade.</p><p>Some foods are more juicy<br>And some are more solid<br>Some are good for your muscles<br>Some are good for emotional development<br>Some are good for spiritual development.</p><p>When I see the madness of people around the food<br>I have nothing other than to smile<br>at the so much focused thinking in one direction<br>that in other dimensions they become bankrupt.</p><p>Two see this, ask yourself,<br>why some people are very solid in their physical health<br>But they are bitter in their emotions?</p><p>Why are some people, who are highly emotional<br>for their loved one or God or guru,<br>but intellectually bank corrupt.<br>Lost the ability to think independently?<br>They cannot hear even<br>a single unpleasant word about their loved one.<br>Not only that they can disturb themselves<br>or the speaker, even if a speaker is saying the truth.</p><p>Why, spiritually advance looking people,<br>suffer loneliness and need a crowd around them<br>to serve them to make them happy.<br>Where is the feeling and experience of oneness?<br>Is that only for books or just one-time phenomenon of life?</p><p>Why people who are intellectually sharp<br>cannot stand and run for one mile on a road?<br>And other times they fail to connect<br>the miseries and joy of others?</p><p>Why do people eat animals but love their pets<br>so as if they are biological children?</p><p>Why do people love their own biological children<br>but don’t feel the same for other children?<br>If all this is not intellectual and emotional disability<br>then what is this called?<br>If this all is not because of improper nourishment<br>then what is the cause of all this?</p><p>Some much has been written,<br>will be written on the food that it is an industry itself.<br>Even well know experts who are recommending<br>all sorts of healthy food to others<br>but doing slow suicide of their own in their other bodies.</p><p>Don’t we see that super successful people feel alone?<br>Super rich people living on pills?<br>Super intelligent people are dry and emotionally dead?<br>Super wealthy people behave like beggars?<br>And a muscular person is lacking the ability<br>to comprehend philosophical ideas?</p><p>You think eating two times or three times is a must<br>otherwise, your overall development will not happen!<br>People work hard, make money for eating and<br>see around how many people are really happy!<br>I mean really happy without any<br>support of other people, object, entertainment.<br>They cannot. What we see is not called happiness<br>but the addiction to food.<br>They need something and someone<br>all the time otherwise they will crash.<br>The presence of other people around them<br>is food for them to live happily.</p><p>You take this modern medical diet system<br>of fat, protein, vitamins, carbohydrates,<br>and their sources so seriously<br>that you don’t even ask questions about<br>how Yogis or Forest dwellers or beggars are much happier<br>than you, who work so much just to eat healthy food?</p><p>Human is the only animal on this planet<br>who doesn’t know what to eat, when to eat<br>and how much to eat even<br>after living 20, 30, 50, or 80 years on this planet.<br>We have religion on the food.<br>We have universities on the food.<br>We have industries on the food.<br>We have experts, doctors, nutrition, religious gurus talking about food.</p><p>But animals without all this grand system<br>Who lives a much shorter life than humans<br>never get confused about what to eat and what not?</p><p>It is we who make animals our pets<br>and dictate their diet and food<br>as we dictate for our children.<br>We are confused, we confuse our children<br>and we confuse animals, birds<br>and reptiles whoever we take as our pet.</p><p>Food is for nourishment.<br>Nourishment is not only about eating.<br>Many times, not eating is also nourishment.<br>Go only juice diet for few days, experience that.<br>Go only water for few days, experience that.<br>Go without food for one day and experience that.<br>Go only with a particular taste<br>for a couple of weeks and experience that.<br>Leave one taste for a few weeks and experience that.<br>Drop one-time food for a few weeks and experience that.</p><p>Go on silence for a day and two and experience that.<br>This is one kind of food.<br>Sit at someplace for sometime<br>without doing anything physically and mentally<br>this is another kind of food needed for your body.</p><p>Live alone in a forest or secluded place<br>without any friend and family<br>This is another food needed to know your own existence.</p><p>O Pratibimba, Spiritual means spirit, it means not matter.<br>To know and experience yourself as a spirit or Atman<br>one needs to design many experiments.<br>Spirituality is not only mental and intellectual gymnasium.<br>It is also about knowing the self as<br>beyond physical, mental, and intellectual food.</p><p>It is about experientially knowing yourself<br>as unborn external Atman.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5144--diwali-2021>Article5144 :

that<br>which we create with our<br>mental, emotional, intellectual ability.<br>This world is our own creation<br>The beauty and ugliness of this<br>depends upon the sharpness of our senses,<br>Our

give them?</p><p>Depending upon the context and situation<br>the answer can vary but if you analyze the answer<br>then you will find the answer is referring<br>to objects and concepts around the answerer.</p><p>For example, people can say<br>I am Indian, I am German.<br>I work for Toshiba, I work for Infosys.<br>I am 40 years old, I live in Bangalore.<br>I am married, I have two children<br>I have a penthouse, I have a BMW car<br>I am male, I love playing football.<br>I am peace loving person,<br>I donate for the poor children’s education<br>I am an atheist but believe in universal power.<br>And it keeps going on.</p><p>If you analyze these sentences<br>then you will find sentences<br>containing ‘am’ ‘do’ ‘did’ ‘have’ ‘believe’.</p><p>How it is different from<br>I have two hands, two lungs,<br>I believe I have a soul<br>I love reading books etc.</p><p>Some objects are obvious and visible<br>so it looks odd to tell about those objects.<br>So people tell about that<br>which is not obvious or not visible to others.</p><p>Either you refer to obvious objects<br>or non-obvious things as yourself,<br>You are referring to your surroundings as you.<br>You are referring to your actions and beliefs as you.</p><p>But in truth, if someone is doing an act of<br>believing, loving, or having then that is one’s identity.<br>Is that the ultimate identity of that person?</p><p>When people get fed up with business, relationships,<br>or objects like a car, computer, etc<br>they leave them and move<br>to another place and another relationship.<br>It may be painful but easier to leave physical things.</p><p>Because of your time, money, and emotional investment<br>in those things, mentally you still hold those.<br>Can you leave those mentally?</p><p>Whatever hard method you try to leave mentally<br>that makes things more sticky and dirty.<br>It is like grease.</p><p>People try different entertainment<br>or mind engagement activities and believe it will go<br>But when you see a similar face<br>or listen to similar sounds, or smells, etc<br>it resurfaces and the same problem starts.<br>Why? because as long as you have a healthy brain,<br>the mind doesn’t drop things.</p><p>It is not that simple to drop things mentally<br>as you can drop your computer<br>and replace it with a new computer.</p><p>But why this problem happens to almost every human being<br>and we don’t use the correct remedy for this?</p><p>All Human pay the price of referring to objects,<br>and the environment around them as themselves.<br>And when a problem happens you drop the physical objects<br>and environment but your whole life<br>the practice of referring to objects as self<br>is still held in your memory system.</p><p>People take the help of psychologists, music,<br>live with different people and in different environments<br>it helps a little bit and this is not the solution.</p><p>You live in some house and<br>your close person dies in that house<br>some people change their house for better living.<br>But other people resolve not to leave the house till their last breath<br>because they enjoy the memories of their loved ones in the house.<br>Either you leave or live in the house<br>both are happening because of object referral<br>or referring to objects and environment as the self.</p><p>From books or sermons or spiritual discourses,<br>we have heard we are Atma or soul or Rooh or Chetan Tattva etc.<br>But this whole is the bookish idea<br>It is like you are living in a desert and you learned<br>how to swim by reading a book.<br>You ask any person whether he believes in god or not<br>Irrespective of their answer,<br>almost all believe they have Atma or soul or spirit.</p><p>The tragedy is that they believe.<br>They don’t experience themselves as Atman.<br>The tragedy is they say ‘I have Soul’ not ‘I am Soul’<br>“I have a car” and “I am a car” both are not the same ideas.<br>“I have Atma” and “I am Atma” both are not the same ideas.<br>But people say I have Atma like I have a car.</p><p>O Chaitanya, “you are not a body” but “you have a body”.<br>“You are Atman” and “you don’t have atman”.<br>Referring to nonself as self and<br>self as nonself throughout your whole life<br>is the price that humanity pays for suffering,<br>Dukha and unrest in the mind.</p><p>No God, Guru, or Doctor can cure this disease.<br>The disease causes us bondage.<br>No Jeeva likes bondage even cattle want to be free.<br>But because of the wrong Identification,<br>we become like cattle, slaves of

satisfaction then<br>There is no pain in exhaling.<br>It happens automatically, and it is as satisfying as inhaling.<br>Without inhaling, there is hope for exhaling<br>Without exhaling, there is no hope for inhaling.</p><p>Inhaling is life, exhaling is death.<br>We know after inhaling is exhaling is a must<br>In fact, when we breathe in with peace,<br>we can breathe out with peace.<br>But when we don’t know we are breathing<br>Then inhaling or exhaling doesn’t matter.<br>In fact, we foolishly think inhaling is the only way to live.<br>And don’t appreciate the power of exhaling.</p><p>Living is between life and death.<br>Living is in between breath-in and breath-out.<br>Living is a coin with two sides, called inhale and exhale.<br>Living is a coin with two sides, we can call them life and death.</p><p>When we don’t know how to live<br>Then we are afraid of dying<br>When we live every moment in consciousness,<br>then where is the fear of dying?<br>Millions of exhaling we do in life, so millions of times we die.<br>There is one exhale in life<br>After which we don’t inhale, that is the final dying.</p><p>If you get an opportunity to live in a village or forest<br>You will notice there are thousands of reptiles,<br>Insects, birds, and other animals.<br>They also live and die but when they die<br>they are not cremated or buried like humans.</p><p>But we don’t find their bodies lying<br>here or there in the village or forest.<br>Except when some animal has eaten another animal,<br>you will notice some bone lying around.<br>So where do they go?<br>Where do they drop their body?<br>Does it happen that during some work animal has<br>all of a sudden, heart attack happens, and it dies?<br>Or it has overeaten and died because of excessive food?<br>Or because of inappropriate lifestyle,<br>they develop diabetes, and they die because of insulin or obesity?</p><p>When they live, they live fully.<br>When the time of death come<br>perhaps they know it much in advance.<br>So they prepare for it and withdraw from<br>day to activities and isolate from remaining<br>birds, reptiles, and animals and<br>drop the body in some awareness.</p><p>Human is a social and economic animal<br>It has learned several things from different animals<br>For most of us, enjoyment means<br>when we have eat enough, wandered enough, slept enough,<br>had sex, fed others, or overpowered others.<br>But these same activities give satisfaction to animals.<br>The only thing is we do these things in different ways.</p><p>Thus, we learned to live from animals.<br>Or we are a kind of animal, so we know how to live.<br>But we are the only animals who don’t know how to die.<br>Most people think learning how to die means how to suicide!<br>Have you seen animals are doing suicide?<br>But they still die!</p><p>By constant putting food,<br>different kinds of food and medicine inside the body, we keep it up.<br>In fact, we are so much engrossed in nurturing the body<br>that when it starts saying time is over<br>we don’t listen and keep living with other people<br>and keep taking medicines or food or remain in hospital.<br>When life is really over,<br>Then what food or medicine can bring more life?</p><p>But this all happens because<br>we have not learned to live a life.<br>The day human learns how to live<br>They will not feel hopeless<br>when they have to think about dying<br>They will not feel too much about insurance,<br>taxes and hospital expenses.<br>He will not feel crazy about loosing<br>all the relations and wealth accumulated here.</p><p>O Pratibimba, if humans have learned living without<br>knowing the art of living, then s/he missed the art of dying<br>and if s/he missed this lesson during her/his lifetime, then<br>that

surprises.<br>To make the future certain and predictable,<br>he wants to plan future actions, have future strategies.<br>That is why he loves prediction.</p><p>But prediction is possible when statistics and<br>past data roam together in the analytical human mind.<br>Individual Human has limited capability and capacity<br>to access and process past data.<br>Hence, we needed a machine.<br>Independent of humans, these machines<br>can use statistics and data together.<br>But the analytical human mind gives them algorithms.<br>This is how AI takes birth to tell you the future.</p><p>Now, machines can tell you how much inventory<br>you need to hold to make an optimal profit,<br>When you need to advertise to have maximum sales.<br>How much to produce to maximize profit.<br>What is there in the given image.<br>Which next music you can enjoy.<br>What is the meaning of textual feedback on your website.<br>What is the sentiment of long paragraph feedback.<br>What is the answer to your question.<br>What are the possible question and their answer<br>by reading a product manual.</p><p>We can create AI apps that help you predict the future,<br>getting gems from the mine of endless data.<br>You need AI to answer your personal, social,<br>business, political, and scientific questions.<br>Now AI started entering into all the aspects of life<br>like software started entering into every business in 90s<br>and the phone started entering into<br>every home in the first and second decade of the 21st century.</p><p>Earlier time someone who can tell future we call him god.<br>Then we called him future teller or Jyotish.<br>Now we call that AI.</p><p>But who knows the future of an unconditioned and free soul?<br>No god, Jyotish, or AI can tell anything about a free soul.<br>The free soul has a free will unaffected from the past karma.<br>Unaffected from Affection (Raga) or Aversion (Dvesa) or Desire (Iccha).<br>So past data does not drive their decision.<br>What will they do? No one knows.<br>Whether they will do anything or not? No one knows.<br>So all gods, Jyotish and AI are helpless before a liberated soul.</p><p>The concept of an unconditioned soul is good.<br>But is there any completely free soul?<br>How does he live when he is in the body?</p><p>In today’s time when AI can predict<br>What you will eat, when you will sleep,<br>what health problem you can have,<br>when you will buy and what you will buy,<br>when you will date and with whom,<br>whether you will have a successful marriage with X person or not.<br>Whether you will lose money or make money in the stock market.<br>Who can be your friend and who cannot.<br>How much ice will melt and how many cities can emerge in water.<br>Who will win an election and who will lose.<br>In this situation, human has not become a slave to AI.<br>But the human was a slave of his own desires.<br>Which bounds him to action.<br>Action bounds him to results.<br>Result bounds him to like and dislike.<br>Like, dislike bound him to reaction.<br>And all this data makes prediction possible.<br>Statistics, AI, and Machine Learning is<br>just looking at your patterns and telling you about you,<br>which you completely have forgotten.</p><p>But they do not remind you of your real nature<br>Like ancient Gurus reminded you, “Tat Tvam Asi”<br>Jyotish, AI, and Future Tells are reminding you<br>that you are salve of circumstances,<br>situations, environment, and your own desire.</p><p>You want to choose freedom or slavery is your choice.<br>You choose Jyotish/AI to tell you the future is your choice.<br>You choose Guru who tells you are an absolute unbound

meditate with open eyes<br>then the objective is to handle the worldly affair properly.<br>Doing work with Dhyana.<br>Knowing the world properly and working properly.</p><p>When you want to mediate with close eyes<br>then the objective is to know.<br>Know your own system, your existence,<br>your mind, your nature, your desires, restlessness,<br>flickering and fluctuations of the mind,<br>ego, jealousy, like, dislike of your mind.<br>Raga and Dvesa of your mind.</p><p>The design of our sense organs is such that<br>it is outward-going and<br>it helps navigate the external world very efficiently.</p><p>As strong your sense organs<br>with that much force, you will be navigating<br>the color, sound, smell, sensation, and taste<br>around you or in your memory.</p><p>Due to some reason<br>if by birth some sense is weak<br>then the neural system reorganizes itself<br>and the neural resources of that organ<br>are shared between other normal senses.</p><p>Our sense organs ensure our survival.<br>In case, if a particular sense organ is weak<br>then an external attack from the environment<br>can kill or damage the body.<br>For example, if someone has lost his taste sense<br>then he may die at any time<br>because of eating poison or improper food<br>which his tongue could have detected easily,<br>if it were working properly.</p><p>When you sit at someplace that is lightened,<br>having music around, some fragrance or bad smell around<br>and you want to take your awareness<br>inside the body then it becomes a difficult task.</p><p>Why? Because eyes go and look at the objects,<br>color, shape, and intensity of light falling on the objects<br>and making us aware of our surroundings.<br>Mind and stored memories may like some of these things around<br>or may not like other things around.</p><p>Similarly, when you are sitting in a room,<br>and some music is going on or sound is present,<br>because of memories mind may like<br>some music or sounds and may not like it.</p><p>Similarly, it happens for smell and fragrance.<br>Your mind may like some smells and may not like others.</p><p>When the temperature in the room is making<br>you uneasy or the seat on which you are sitting is too soft<br>or too hard then your mind may like or may not like it.</p><p>You may not be hungry but if some food is before you,<br>then your mind may have the temptation to eat that<br>or may feel disgusted depending upon what food is kept before you.</p><p>This like and dislike of the mind due to different reasons<br>has roots in the outward nature of the senses.<br>It will never allow you to meditate inside.<br>The body wants to take action to make the environment<br>more friendly for living or survival.</p><p>Your sense of imagination, visualizing different colors,<br>shapes, forms, smells, etc help you in Bhakti and external meditation.<br>This object may be your worldly object,<br>your sweet relationships with someone, or Ishwara or Ishta Devta.</p><p>But when you want to know your nature<br>and meditate inside then these sense organs are a big problem<br>because they are designed to navigate the outside world.</p><p>So in my experience when a room is completely empty and dark,<br>no noise, no fragrance, no extreme temperature<br>so that you can sit with a single lightest cloth,<br>and without hurting your body,<br>you are not feeling hungry<br>nor you have eaten food immediately before,<br>your stomach is empty or you have eaten 2 or 3 hours before.<br>This is the proper setup to navigate inside.</p><p>In this situation mentally travel between<br>the environment around you and within your body<br>with your rhythm inhaling and exhaling.</p><p>If you are able to do this even for 5 minutes<br>and improve this slowly you will be able to know yourself.<br>And probably one day you will be able<br>to learn to live in the present<br>and renounce your fear of the future and guilt of the past.<br>At least for the duration of meditation.</p><p>If you keep doing it regularly<br>one day will come when even the most adverse situations<br>can not throw you out of balance,<br>but because of certain circumstances, if it happens<br>then you will be able to come to the center quickly.</p><p>O Chaitanya, did you ever try to meditate<br>when the situations in your life are adverse?<br>Did you try to be meditative to know your own mind?<br>Did you try to know who you really are<br>apart from the heap of food<br>which you have accumulated within you in the form<br>of mental ideas (like I am Atma, I am soul, I am jiva, heaven, hell, god)?<br>This mental food comes from your books and teachers.<br>The food can be physical food,<br>which you accumulated and makes your body mass,<br>which you get by eating tasty food.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5151--earnings-of-life>Article5151 : Earnings Of Life<a class=td-heading-self-link

Process<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5152--learning-process aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Education, &lsquo;My Views&rsquo;]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>When you see some long physics or maths formula then don’t get scared of it. It is just a way to represent the reality. Is it an absolute reality? No, it just represents that reality, and the absolute reality is very close to this. Whether it is a formula of gravity or force or angular momentum or energy calculations or anything else.</p><p>But how do these formulas come into existence? Inquisitiveness, a deep thinking mind, and a habit of learning are instrumental to this.</p><p>What is learning? Generalization of observation is learning. If you are memorizing then very soon you will reach to confused state with lots of data in your mind. In learning, process memory is used to look back but till the time you don’t identify patterns in learning it is not learning.</p><p>Once you are able to generalize then you can state that in the form of physics formulas or laws or moral rules or social rules of an unknown society.</p><p>Will that formula or rule work for you in all situations? Well, it depends on how many people/samples are observed, how long it was observed, the quality of a dedicated focused mind observing, etc.</p><p>For example, some people have a knowledge (generalization) that if you are walking alone and the lion sees you it will kill you. Reason? People can develop many reasons once they are convinced of their conclusion. But that is not the right way of reaching to a conclusion. By seeing movies, and listening to stories we generalize and then make a certain opinion about events, objects, people, environment, etc around them.</p><p>A black cat crosses your way when you are going for auspicious work. It is not good. It is a conclusion. It is a simple formula without mathematical representation. But you can put that in mathematical terms as well. Because this is a social stigma so physicists don’t bother to put that in a math formula.</p><p>If an object slip from a 10-meter height terrace it will go down. What speed it will travel? How hard it will hit the ground? How much force is required to stop it at 5-meter height etc are all human questions. For many centuries people were puzzled over this observation that why everything falls down and then somebody could give us a physics formula to calculate and know the answer to all the questions, we had. Using these formulas we could develop technology and fly in space.</p><p>Suppose you have a formula or law or rule written on your paper, this applies to a rock piece but does not apply to other objects then will you really call that a rule? Yes, we will, but only for rocks and not for anything else.</p><p>But if you observe deeply you will know that the particular law doesn’t apply to subatomic particles! Is that rule reliable? Is that rule useful? Yes, and it has its own usefulness and limitations!</p><p>Generalization of certain concepts is learning. The more is a generalization, the more is learning.</p><p>That is why the best scientists ask the question what is that one law, principle, or formula by which everything can be explained? They are struggling hard with a different name and trying to unify all the know laws of matter, force, and energy but still, nothing is explaining that one.</p><p>Can they do it? I don’t know.<br>Is there one thing from which everything has come? I think everything has come into existence from ‘no’ thing so the search is good to know more about our existence and the reality of the cosmos but looking for a ‘thing’ is not a good idea.

self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Education ]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>After spending a decade in training, consulting, Coaching and mentoring activities I started believing that the IQ of a person should not be measured on the basis of facts, what a person knows. In fact in this information age when search engines know more facts than any single human it is an outdated way of measuring IQ.</p><p>Corporations are spending a lot of money in selecting good candidates for the role in their projects and organization but they are also not going beyond question answers interviews or a standard exam. Most of the time MCQ are the criteria of evaluating. In a limited time how can we select a good candidate?</p><p>If you throw some facts before a candidate, and ask him to propose some unique interesting questions. That can be a good assessment of a thinking mind. What kind of thought and mind he has. In the next step ask him to get the answer to those questions. This shows what he has done in the past.</p><p>Does he feel excited in asking those questions or feeling that these are rhetorical questions? Does he feel excited in solving those or has he memorized some answers and repeating from memory.</p><p>In the process of gaining experience and learning something new we need to use memory. For what purpose we use memory is an important thing. Most people use memory to remember facts; they use it to “retain” concepts. Why? Because they don&rsquo;t “learn” concepts and ideas. For most people, the purpose of reading books is getting more facts and information, they rarely focus on ideas.</p><p>To evaluate the IQ, let&rsquo;s see one example, how to ask questions from the facts.<br>Facts:</p><ol><li>Earth completes rotation around the sun in 365 days.</li><li>Circle is 360 degree angle.</li><li>Day has 24 hours.</li><li>Moon completes one rotation around earth in 28 days.</li><li>There are four seasons in Delhi.</li></ol><p>Using the above facts, ask as many questions and propose as many answers. Avoid rhetorical questions. If you ask a question which is asked by many other people then you get lesser points. Lessor times that question is asked more points you get.</p><p>Possible Questions:<br>How many degrees does the earth rotate in a day?<br>How many latitude and longitude shifts happen on earth in one hour?<br>How much does the moon rotate around the earth in one hour? What is the rotation on a full moon day on the equator?</p><p>One of the biggest problems of our education is they are giving lots of facts, expecting learners to memorize the answer, learners remember the facts and information but they are ignoring information. They don’t know how to use that information. The main reason for that is they are not asking the right questions.</p><p>I am not against the memorization of facts. If someone can remember facts that is great. But the greatest thing is assimilate information, stitch the facts together and know what is not obvious.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5166--understanding-maya-2>Article5166 : Understanding Maya 2<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5166--understanding-maya-2 aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Vedanta, Maya, Parenting]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>When you see sun is rising and settings<br>But you know it doesn&rsquo;t</p><p>Approx 72 inch is human body height<br>One inch in eye size<br>One tenth is size of pupil in the eye<br>A small dust particle is enough to stop us seeing the world around<br>But we can big objects around and compare<br>From eyes we know a cow is bigger than a goat<br>Goat is bigger than cat<br>Cat is bigger than mouse<br>Mouse is bigger than ant<br>Ant is bigger than sugar particle<br>None of these objects or their sizes<br>exists in our mind<br>Still we can compare<br>Retina of eye convert light signals to electric signals<br>Brain processes electric signals<br>Processing of these signals is chemical process<br>Process is same for all human being<br>But even after that<br>we all understand the world in different way<br>It is Maya.</p><p>We see around thousands of broken heart<br>Thousands of broken marriage<br>Thousands of cheating and deceiving around.<br>But we still want get married, still have friends, relations<br>This is Maya.</p><p>We have not seen our great grandparents<br>We know we have come from those human<br>We know they have disappeared<br>We know we will also disappear at one moment<br>But we still behave like we are permanent here.</p><p>We know great Kings of earlier time had huge wealth,<br>empire, power, Large families, buildings etc.<br>Today we don&rsquo;t see those kings around<br>Probably their great grandchildren are begging on the roads.<br>But we still want to work and earn like<br>Our earnings can make our children and great grandchildren safe.<br>This is Maya.</p><p>We buy insurance, pension, large houses<br>Big cars, beautiful foreign destination<br>to buy comfort and hope happiness will come,<br>Security will come.<br>We know many are suffering even after having all these<br>But we still want to have more.<br>This is maya.</p><p>Couple see many parents are abundant by their children<br>Many children have been suffering since childhood.<br>Many accidents and tragedies bring pain for the whole family.<br>Many mistreat their parents.<br>Abuse their property and compromise values and positions.<br>But we still see happiness in having children<br>This is maya.</p><p>We have taken birth.<br>Grown up and matured enough.<br>If we understand the maya clearly.<br>Then there is nothing to do.<br>There is no goal, no work, even basic earning for survival looks meaningless<br>It looks like there is nothing else to do in the world.</p><p>Now, when we are just sitting idle without any work,<br>we feel let&rsquo;s go and play<br>In the process of play we get entangled in the game.<br>We got to the extent that we want to own the playground and other players.<br>We want to determine the rules of the game in the playground.<br>This is maya.</p><p>One day when we are kicked out of the playground<br>Then we realize, play was real our attitude towards<br>the playing caused us all pain, suffering and miseries.</p><p>O Chaitanya, play well<br>Ready to drop whatever you acquired through your hard play.<br>Your giving, taking, producing all are happening in Maya.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5167--about-friendship>Article5167 : About Friendship<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5167--about-friendship aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [ Life, Friendship]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>The definition of friendship in real life is not the same as in social media. In the age of social media Connecting relatives, colleagues, like minded people is considered friendship. It has its own utility.

In every life very few relations deserve to qualify for that special friendship. Otherwise all are transactions of give and take depending upon time, place, and situation. The role of people can change from squeezer to squeezed.</p><p>It takes time to build relationships, some come from bloodline, but they can spoil because of a few abnormal transactions.</p><p>A friend is that person, whose name fills your mind with peace, security. A name, which drops formality and brings a feeling of care. A name with which you feel, it is beyond logic and beyond your physical existence. A name that brings a smile to your face.</p><p>With whom you need not to prove.<br>With whom you don&rsquo;t feel high nor low.<br>With whom you feel he or she is part of your emotional existence.</p><p>One, whose physical existence around gives a feeling of light heartedness.<br>Even if he/she is not physically available you can feel him or her in your mind.<br>Whose body and mind you don&rsquo;t want to mess with but he/she energizes you.</p><p>If you ask something from your friend and it is not given then you understand there must be a valid and good reason and it must be good for either me or for our friendship.</p><p>Friendship of the following is very dangerous and can break you unexpectedly.</p><p>Highly emotional people, a person who fluctuates too much.<br>Who don&rsquo;t know/remember what they said, and just busy in saying anything for the heck of saying. Many times out of habit people say “I love you”, they don’t feel it.

Consciousness is everywhere in the entire universe but awareness belongs to life. Plants, insects, animals, and humans have awareness. When you are sleeping you are conscious but not aware. Body parts which make life, like tissues, cells and protein have awareness. Do molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons have awareness? Does the earth, moon, sun and other stars have awareness? Ancient eastern wisdom says the cosmos is not dead therefore even the sky has awareness.</p><p>Even after death, for sometime some body parts are conscious locally but body level awareness is lost.</p><p>We know awareness is the result of consciousness but at what level of existence do objects become self aware or surrounding aware?</p><p>Answers are extremely hard even after so much advancement of science. It looks that because everything is conscious so everything is self aware and environment aware as well. It means even a stone and a piece of furniture is self aware. Question is only of degree. Because it is extremely low self aware therefore it cannot be measured. Like advanced MRI machines can help you measure the kind and degree of human emotions and awareness.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5172--play-on-your-strength>Article5172 : Play on your Strength<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5172--play-on-your-strength aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Life ]</p><p>Namaste,</p><p>Mentally or physically everybody has a unique design.

That too when he asked.</p><p>Normal chit chat is fine but serious advice should not be given to your friend, if it is not asked. Today&rsquo;s situation is such, we give suggestions to everyone, even to the unknown. Shaking someone for the reality so that one can search one&rsquo;s truth is one thing but telling one the absolute truth, without asking, is not good practice.</p><p>Today there are people who are ready to teach Bhagwat Gita but Arjuna is missing from war field, sometimes Arjuna is there but he is so arrogant that he doesn&rsquo;t ask his friend who can teach, other times he casually ask and wisdom is given but Arjuna doesn&rsquo;t pay heed. Most of the time Arjuna in the war field thinks anything but Bhagwat Gita is the solution of today&rsquo;s kurukshetra. So he does everything but doesn&rsquo;t come to the point and suffers in the whole war.</p><p>Most Hindus are not interested in teaching, memorizing any book of any sect or religion. If you teach them then most ignorant will ask you practical questions. What is in it for me, don&rsquo;t preach me heaven, hell and god. Please solve today&rsquo;s problem. And this is that idea which should be highly appreciated in any practical man.</p><p>Even Vedas, Upnishads were not taught to all.

What is the nonsense going on in this 21st century? Especially when we are saying we are an advanced civilization.

Because you do not have credibility to be believed so you refer from the best seller books, holy books, from your guru&rsquo;s books etc. After this you think, your experience is transmitted to others.<br>Fortunately the human mind doesn&rsquo;t work that way and the message is still not gone. See around how many holy books, Guru-Vaakya, best selling books, are existing. How many people “truly” believe in those books?</p><p>If you have conviction on your truth then why to use others as a gun to fire your bullet? Can&rsquo;t we be honest and straight to speak even our own tapasya and realization? And for that, most of humanity is peddling and recycling the same old information and they don&rsquo;t have time to realize even iota of that, which they are referring to in the book.</p><p>In Indian culture we never had that tradition of quotations. We have a culture of &ldquo;sayings&rdquo;, &ldquo;proverbs&rdquo;, &ldquo;kim-danti&rdquo;, &ldquo;lok-katha&rdquo;, &ldquo;sloka&rdquo; but we don&rsquo;t believe blindly on those. No matter who said whether Guru or Devta or Devi or God. No matter where it is written we still apply our mind and then navigate our life. We have a shraddha for all, for the initial period of time when you are entering into that school of thought or gurukula. But living your whole life on those written words and keeping your intellect in a locker is not part of Hindu culture.</p><p>People from Abrahmic religion refer to books and treat their books sacrosanct. Every time saying it is written in that book, our messenger said this, it is said by big scientists or politicians or great guru etc. It means, I don&rsquo;t have the guts to say that truth or don&rsquo;t have necessary experience.</p><p>In these situations does it make sense to say anything, which we want to say? Can&rsquo;t we remain silent and do Tapasya to experience that truth and then say it? Is it a fear of copyright violation or fear of not getting acceptance?

Or, out of her/his power, either she/he can give or punish you. So out of that fear you do Namaste. This is Vyapar Drushti. My business will lose if I don&rsquo;t pay my due.</p><p>Second reason for Namaste may be wisdom. Because of someone&rsquo;s behavior you learn that he or she is wise and his presence makes your life experience rich. He can help you dive deeper in life so because of that greed you bow down to someone. This is Swakalyan Dristi. I will grow if there is grace of this person upon me.</p><p>Third reason may be habits, which are given to us by our culture. Out of habit we do Namaste. It doesn&rsquo;t have much meaning or depth. It is like you are driving your car and out of habit whenever you see a traffic light or traffic police you slow down or stop, even without desire. Sometimes meaningless but yes this is how we are trained in training school or on the road by earlier drivers. This is Sanskar Drushti. People will call me bad if I don&rsquo;t follow the rules of the game.</p><p>Final reason for doing namaste is I have seen something deeper in you. The same tattva which I am, Atma Tattva. As a body I bow down before that Tattva. Although that Tattva is in me and you and all life around. Yet whenever I see some life moving around, it may be a cow going by, or a flower in the garden, or tree standing around, or a lovely laughing/ joyful face going before me, I experience that Tattva in me. I see there is life, and hence there is that same tattva behind, which is moving me. Hence I do namaskar to that Tattva. This is Gyan Drushti.</p><p>Your body and my body both have come from the same soil. Every day it is recycling. Body is always dead, Atmatattva keep it live. Therefore a body that came 20 years before or some came 20 years after doesn&rsquo;t make any difference from Atmatattva or Atmabodha perspective. Because Atma is never born and never dies. Which has not born is ageless and actually everyone is that ageless being. It is different that this truth never comes in our experience like the speed of earth never comes to our experience but truth is, the earth runs around the sun at 1.10 lakh kilometers/hours.</p><p>What kind of namaste or namaskar, you do or expect from others? You can ask yourself.</p><p>But good morning is completely meaningless. Somebody had fought with his or her spouse in the morning, you ignorantly saying morning is good, does he even have that experience at that moment? He will simply repeat the words out of etiquettes.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5179--why-is-life-complex>Article5179 : Why is life complex?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5179--why-is-life-complex aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Life, My Views ]</p><p>Instinct is something which every life has on this planet.<br>And it helps them in their survival.<br>If survival is the goal of life then instinct is good enough.</p><p>But human has two other great capabilities<br>which other animals don&rsquo;t have.<br>These are the capabilities of reasoning and intuition.</p><p>Most of the people are suffering from a disease called busyness.<br>So, they don&rsquo;t get time to pause and think about the meaning of life.<br>Therefore they use these two functions also for survival<br>and the tragedy is that your whole life goes like this.</p><p>Up until the last breath they wish something else<br>could have been done or<br>that could have been done in better way<br>to make life more comfortable<br>or better than their next neighbor or their challenger.</p><p>But all these questions come from our desire to survive better.<br>This is how we create unnecessary fuss and drama<br>around the simple things of life<br>and cry life has become complex.</p><p>When you use powerful tools<br>to solve the simple survival problem of life<br>then it is like using a sword to sew your torn shirt.<br>What will you get? tatters!</p><p>But people don&rsquo;t get this simple point of using<br>wrong tool throughout their entire might to make life comfortable<br>Or make it more rich, so they keep suffering their whole life.</p><p>If comfort was the goal then rich and comfortable people<br>like Siddhartha, Nanak Sahib, Meera were fool<br>to pause and seek something more meaningful?<br>They went out of their physical comfort and<br>struggled enough to get that<br>which gives unshaken peace even to face the worst of life.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5180--there-is-no-god>Article5180 : There is no God!<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5180--there-is-no-god aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [My Views, Theist ]</p><p>If our Karma and Law or Karma is everything then what is the need of God?</p><p>People say Karma is everything but they are afraid of this rule.

But where to go and say sorry and who will forgive? Thus culture invented a big father concept, called God. Go and please Him, say sorry to Him and He will forgive you.</p><p>Once God is there then people can become irresponsible they can do all nonsense and put a mercy petition before God. Or they can ask all kind of questions, like why I am suffering I am great devotee, I am good person, I have done so much donation, I have helped so many people, I am hard working person, I am honest, I have done three times prayer every day etc. So why am I suffering?</p><p>They feel God is responsible for their misery in life. Even after so much donation at a temple or orphanage if I am suffering then what is the use of all this good Karma.</p><p>Because they don&rsquo;t find any other responsible person around, with whom they talk or pull in the court for their misery, so they become atheist. As if God will become any less by this act or their misery will reduce. As long as human life is there whether you are rich or poor, married or single, have children or childless you all suffer. God has nothing to do with your businesses and worldly designations and positions. But, unfortunately humans need God only for these transactions because they don&rsquo;t know anything else other than this kind of business.</p><p>If this is the state of affairs then even a so-called happy devotee is doing business with God but his business is going good. One day when he loses money, health, relationship, people, social or temple respect he will also become atheist.</p><p>O Chaitanya, how to raise human consciousness so that they realize that even beyond the losses and profit of his life, life around in the cosmos is extremely complex and we don&rsquo;t know how all this is happening smoothly? There is someone, there is something, which we want to know through our efforts and not from the books or temples or preachers. But for that they need to pause for a moment from their daily race which is taking them from birth to death.

Tantra : A way to control your own life energy. Live your every breath. Live life in totality and without duality. Hundreds of Agama Tantra Shastra defines them but unfortunately this is the most misunderstood work of Bharat. Whoever tries to speak boldly on this is either sidelined or he does something nasty and people do not listen to him. Finally it remained in the hands of those who cannot communicate it to the world.</p><p>B. Yoga : A way to control your own body. Make your body flexible. It has eight stages to reach to perfection. Purpose was to live a healthy physical life as long as you want. This became so bad that people started linking it to exercise, jogging, body twisting, music, stretching, religion and what not.</p><p>C. Upanishad : They are also called Vedanta and Darshan Shastra. In western world they call it the Indian Philosophical system. A way to understand existence at intellectual level. For many it is too complex to decode the meaning. Many of those who could decode this feel hair splitting reasons and too much stress on reasoning is useless. Many cannot take it beyond philosophy and the system of logic. So it ended up in the hands of very few who don&rsquo;t care much about the world and the world doesn&rsquo;t care much about them. Because, today&rsquo;s time is about advertisement, marketing, presentation, demo, and visibility.</p><p>Tragedy is those who take interest in science and technology don&rsquo;t soak themselves, to understand and connect well between modern science and these systems. They conveniently pick up random experiments of science or statements of scientists and justify their thinking.

Karma means which is done.</p><p>Whatever needs to be done for that you need to have your desire and intention. In Sanskrit it is called Sankalp. So without Sankalp, you cannot do any karma.</p><p>Karmafala means the outcome of that karma. Karmafala has nothing to do with whether you like it or not, whether it is good for you or bad. For example, you do a karma of eating a brick of ice cream at 6 am in the morning then this karma has karmafala. How ice cream will respond to your body at a particular time depends upon many factors and not just the karma of eating.</p><p>When Karmafala has unfolded before you then it is up to you, whether you like it or not. That is another karma and thus the cycle keeps going. Whether you like it or not depends upon you. And how you respond after that like or dislike is 100% your choice.</p><p>So karma cannot be done without Sankalp. If this is the case then what is the meaning of selfless karma? Saklap has a deep connection with self. This self can be your body, your child, your parents, your village, your company, your nation, your religion, your community, your race etc.</p><p>It looks like selfless karma means karma that is done for a larger self, which has a larger and far radius of impact. This &lsquo;far&rsquo; can be in terms of time or in terms of space.</p><p>Nishkam Karma means a Karma, which is done without self desire. But the desire still exists. The desire for a larger self around.</p><p>Karma whether for yourself or for the larger self around you. You need a Sankalpa for Karma. Selfless means there is no individual. Where is the question of Karma in that state of mind?</p><p>O Pratibimba! What is your experience of selfless Karma and Nishkam Karma?</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5196--solution-of-a-problem>Article5196 : Solution of a Problem<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5196--solution-of-a-problem aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Life, Vedanta ]</p><p>There are two worlds around us. One is the real world and another is the projected world. In both worlds objects are the same but their impact on us is different. In the real world, things exist the way they are, as per their Swabhav. In the projected world things exist as per our Swabhav plus the world&rsquo;s interaction (Vyavhar) with us.</p><p>For example, a black cat standing before has its own existence whether you are aware of it or not. Whether you think good or bad about it. Whether you feel loving or hateful toward it. This is the real cat of the real world. But within our mind, we have a world and there is also a black cat in that world. This is our own projected world. It is 100% our own creation. How we create this projected world is our own mental karma and this karma will give you Karmafala accordingly. Real cat out can not cause us that much damage as our projected world and its objects.</p><p>In the absolute (real, natural) world around us there is no problem. Everything is happening as per the karma of living bodies. Whatever happening is inevitable and the best possible could have happened is happening at the moment. So there is no problem and no solution required.</p><p>In the projected world everything is happening as per our own mental karma and we are looking for a solution to fix the problem outside. We can work hard and try to fix it. But it is like putting first aid on the mirror when your cheek is wounded. After treatment, for some time it looks like there is no wound now or it will be healed but as soon as you move on to the mirror you see the wound again. This way you can plaster the whole mirror but the pain is still there on the cheek.</p><p>So the projected world doesn&rsquo;t have any permanent or perfect solution. Keep working and moving. Expecting a permanent solution of our worries in the world is like a mirage, water perceived in the desert.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5197--time-and-present>Article5197 : Time and Present<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5197--time-and-present aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>tags: [Time, Kaala ]</p><p>One second is made of 1000 milliseconds.<br>One millisecond is made of 1000 microseconds.<br>One microsecond is made of 1000 nanoseconds.<br>One nanosecond is made of 1000 picoseconds.</p><p>So, one second is made of 10^12 picoseconds.<br>Thus a picosecond is a very small unit of time.</p><p>If you keep going down then you reach a limit of time where time cannot be divided further.<br>What is that smallest unit of time of which all times are made?</p><p>That time is 10^(-43) second.

This past can be 1 microsecond past or 1 picosecond forward future but it is never present.</p><p>But the sadhana of living in the present will bring you very close to your existence and reality. Otherwise, most of the time people keep thinking of the previous day, week, month, year, centuries. Thinking about the past using your present is a feature of the mind. But when the past is bothering you too much or making you too nostalgic then choose to live in the present and don&rsquo;t allow yourself to become the victim of time.

In the last 1000 years we couldn&rsquo;t do much even whatever our ancestors have given to us. We worshiped and did pooja aarti of that, put that on our heads and in some puja rooms and temples.

In this society we expect science to flourish, it is impossible. We may have lots of complaints against western culture but we must appreciate their one point: they respect their scientists, award them, and compensate them properly. Not only that if you go there as a scientist or researcher they respect you.</p><p>To verify this, ask people around the name of great Bhakta, Saint, Musician, God incarnation of the last 1000 years you will get many answers. I don&rsquo;t want to put that list here you all know. Ask yourself, are we only doing this work for the last 1000 years or have we done some great work in the field of science and technology. You cannot even remember 3 names. Why?

Second way is to go and play in the world without wasting time in understanding the world.

Paatrata means eligibility, capacity, capability to hold what is given to you. You can ask for anything, knowledge, money power. This is part of your imagination. But fortunately if your wish is fulfilled and that knowledge, money or power is given to you then can you hold it gracefully, happily and for the benefits of all around? Asking for the river when you are holding a spoon in your hand is foolishness because the flood can destroy you. But mostly people do not know their own eligibility (Paatrata) and keep weeping for their destiny or giver or God.</p><p>Perhaps after giving when cosmic intelligence sees people getting destroyed then She restrain Herself from giving. Humans need to increase the size of Paatra where he will hold what he is asking for.</p><p>These things we see with children when they ask, please teach me how to make a nuclear reactor but they don&rsquo;t know P of physics. Even if you teach them will they be able to use that knowledge or will they listen properly? You know the answer. Similar things apply to power and money. People think it is the easiest thing to handle but in my experience it is very difficult. See around yourself, how wealthy people spoil relationships, health and peace of mind.

Due to this reason when different people see the same event they reason it differently.
Some are able to see the same event mentally and intellectually from 100 directions, some from 10, some from 1 and some even cannot see the event happening before their eyes.</p><p>Reasoning is such a wonderful processing ability in humans that it has the ability to bring all the events on the same plane without emotional bias and it allows seeing things as is.</p><p>In fact, if the mind is calm, free from emotional swings, free from attachment of mine and yours it can help you become judge and do justice. Without logical ability, the human race cannot even think about justice.</p><p>Without reasoning, you cannot generalize concepts correctly and learning is nothing but the process of generalization based on observations. Without reasoning no learning is possible hence no science is possible. Because science is nothing but a generalization of rules based on the patterns which you see in nature.</p><p>The beauty of reason is such, if I enter into some different dimension of the event and tell you a unique reason that you normally couldn’t think of, you will accept my point, and ask yourself how did you miss that. Some people will say it is common sense.</p><p>So common sense is nothing but logic which is expected to be used by the masses all the time.</p><p>Technics like meditation, silent long walks or wandering, sitting long and seeing from the peak of a mountain, on the roof of a high-rise building improve your ability to reason.</p><p>Without reasoning, one cannot live like a human, without proper reasoning which is lesser than common sense society will tag you dumb.</p><p>With emotion-free reasoning, you can see things properly.</p><p>Therefore cleaning and calming the mind is necessary so that you can see without illusion.</p><p>Reasoning has to do with your intellectual ability and not your emotional ability but both are the functions of the brain. In the Indian context, we have Manas and Buddhi, both have different purposes but there is no concept of “mind”. Indian people who have long traditions of Yoga know this very well but when an Indian uses the word “mind” he is confusing himself with this western concept.</p><h1 id=article5207--are-you-feeling-stuck-in-life>Article5207 : Are You Feeling Stuck in Life?<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5207--are-you-feeling-stuck-in-life aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Tags: [Life]</p><p>Life is not a railway track that goes straight. Every life has ups and downs, it has cycles of movement. But it is easy to say when you are at the peak or rising. From my experience, I can say the following will definitely help one in managing the low time of life, especially when you think nothing is moving in life.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify what you truly want:</strong> I am stuck, this can be a vague feeling because something in life is not being “right”. When you have these feelings, then you should clarify what you want. What difference do you want? Frame your desires as what you do want to happen. Create a vision board of what you value, and what is the goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Change your perspective:</strong> Feeling “stuck” can be because of your mindset. With some self-awareness and conscious effort, you can change your inner voice, and your perspective to be more flexible. Ask how else you can see a situation and how you&rsquo;ll feel about it in the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Move your body:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve ever finished the workday with a stiff neck and shoulders, you&rsquo;ll know that tension and stuckness can sit in the body. This is related to the physical body. Exercise, walking in nature, yoga, etc will do wonders for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Set a date and park decisions until then:</strong> Procrastination means delaying action and decision. Sometimes you need time to think and become clear in your head. Don’t feel bad that you are procrastinating. Ask yourself how much more time you want to get the clarity and make the decision. During this time keep reflecting and evaluating your options. This exercise will help you commit strongly to the decision you take.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid &ldquo;analysis paralysis&rdquo;, take a decision:</strong> Once you know what you want, ask yourself, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the next smallest step I could take?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s so easy to get entangled with the stuckness that you forget there are small steps that you could take to make progress.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tap into your agency:</strong> Stuckness can make you want to wallow in helplessness. Identify an aspect of your life where you do feel in control and then do something about it. Doing anything with choice reminds you of your ability to get unstuck.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rest, recharge, and focus on self-care:</strong> During a challenging time, keep in mind that you&rsquo;re responsible for your well-being. Do what you need to look after yourself through a good diet, sleep, healthy movement, and connection.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identifying yourself with a situation is a problem</strong> Say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling stuck,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;I am stuck.&rdquo; Never identify with the feeling. It&rsquo;s subtle but essential because it allows you to remember that feelings pass. No feelings or emotions are permanent.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up:</strong> Many people like to have clarity and control over their lives.
So the feeling of being stuck can be frustrating. Rather than beat yourself up over feeling stuck, treat yourself with self-compassion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t blame others:</strong> We don&rsquo;t live in a vacuum, and others&rsquo; decisions and actions can impact our lives. But dwelling on them isn&rsquo;t productive. Remember that you&rsquo;re ultimately in charge of many aspects of your personal and professional life.</p></li></ol><h1 id=article5208--the-way-of-learning>Article5208 : The Way of Learning<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5208--the-way-of-learning aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Tags: [Education, My Views]</p><p>If you want to teach your children the process of making tea<br>then you don&rsquo;t force them to memorize s for sugar,<br>g for ginger, t for tea, w for water, m for milk, b for boil, etc.<br>And if they don&rsquo;t memorize you punish them?<br>You don&rsquo;t offer them tea?<br>You don&rsquo;t allow them to come into the kitchen till they remember the complete vocabulary?<br>If this is your way of teaching then it is horrible,<br>Children don&rsquo;t need any jail or hell<br>You are Yamraj and they are living in hell.</p><p>Similarly, how do you teach agriculture to your children?<br>Memorize the name of all the seeds, agricultural types of equipment,<br>and different types of sand?<br>Till the time children do not know s for seed, t for tomato, p for potato, etc,<br>you will not take them to a field?<br>Then you are nothing but an agriculture teacher and not a farmer?</p><p>How do you teach trading to your children?<br>Force them to memorize books on trading, pass all the exams,<br>Memorize s for sales, p for profit, d for discount, and c for customer?<br>Force them to memorize the business concepts?<br>If you are doing so then you are an MBA professor, not a Baniya or trader.</p><p>How do you teach any foreign language to children?<br>Memorize a for apple, b for banana, and c for cat?<br>This way, neither you learned English nor your children will learn!<br>If you are doing this then you are an English teacher<br>who have memorized the dictionary and all the rules of grammar<br>but when you have to express yourself or explain some idea then<br>you are struggling to do a mental translation.</p><p>Unfortunately, our education system where we want to standardize education,<br>So that people can choose their careers and<br>do whatever they wish to do in their life, is killing lives and creating machines.</p><p>Children are asking by doing what I can make more money?<br>What should I do so that I become famous?<br>What should I do so that I have all the power in my hands,<br>so that I can control everything and everybody?<br>Not only children, but even so-called mature people are also asking these questions!</p><p>All questions like these are nonsensical<br>but still, there are people around us who try to give answers to these questions!<br>Like you learn Data Science, AI, Acting, Music, Politics,<br>Nanotechnology, Bio-Technology, Robotics etc because these are current trends.<br>After listening to the advice, children go to universities and learn these things.<br>And, how are our universities teaching?<br>A for apple, b for bat, c for cat.<br>Even after you complete your four or five years degree<br>you have not put a single seed in the ground,<br>you have not plowed the field<br>but you are an agriculture engineer!<br>You have not done a single good business deal but you are a Master in Business!<br>You have not created a single software that solves your problem<br>but you are a Software Engineer!<br>You have not created a single machine to solve your problem<br>but you are a mechanical engineer!</p><p>If we open our ancient Sanskrit knowledge sources,<br>we know hundreds of tools, techniques,<br>and processes are discussed in detail to do<br>engineering, administration, and business work.<br>But how did those people create that huge body of knowledge?<br>Not from university research or filing white papers or patents?<br>How did those people impart that knowledge, through theoretical lectures?</p><p>In ancient times we had the Jaati System and Varna System.<br>Because of this system, a child of a farmer will learn farming by going to a farm,<br>without going to an agriculture university.<br>A child of a goldsmith will learn his ancestor&rsquo;s work from his elders.<br>A child of Vaidhya will learn his work from his elders.<br>A child of Purohit will learn his work from his elders, etc.</p><p>This way parents are the first teacher (Pratham Guru).<br>They are respected.<br>A family is united.<br>Society is cooperative and not in competition with each other.<br>Knowledge is practical and not theoretical.<br>What people say, they mean it.

they all will sort things differently.<br>Do not argue or debate or try to prove.<br>Do not bring your ethics or religious values in front to sort this list.<br>For the time being, avoid adding new items<br>or contesting why a particular item is on the list.<br>Keeping some categories in mind this list is created.</p><p>Space, air, fire, water, earth, medicine,<br>plants, bonsai tree, banyan tree, fungi,<br>algae, virus, bacteria, sand, mud, stone,<br>sesame seed, mango seed, mango,<br>cut hair or nails, snake, spider, ant, fly,<br>maggots, flour, roti, old roti, rotten roti,<br>dry daal, cooked daal, old stinky daal,<br>fish, dead fish, moving plants in ocean,<br>insect eater plant, chuimui plant, dead goat,<br>goat, goat&rsquo;s baby, cow, cow&rsquo;s baby, human,<br>human&rsquo;s baby, spoon, window, floor of flat,<br>electricity, magnet, dead body,<br>working brain of a dead body, person in a comma,<br>sick person, poor person, rich person,<br>uneducated person, illiterate person, cultured person,<br>scientist, king or politician, enemy, friend, pig flesh,<br>cow flesh, goat flesh, fish flesh, human flesh, roasted flesh,<br>paneer, milk, curd, ghee, cow dung,<br>vegetable oil, petrol, cream, computer, rail,<br>rocket, airplane, mobile phone,<br>computer model and algorithms like GPT or BERT, robots.</p><p>If you are interested in sorting these items<br>then you are willing to think about life<br>and mystery around.</p><p>If not then you believe in a philosophy that do not think so much,<br>life is already messy, therefore if we think more<br>that will create some more confusion.<br>Therefore, eat what you like, and behave the way it suits you<br>or what is suitable as per the law, make money,<br>enjoy life, thinking doesn&rsquo;t solve any problem,<br>in fact when you consume some substance<br>and your mind stops working,<br>then that is the best thing you want to happen.</p><p>This is another way of living,<br>living like a bird or cow or tree of a forest.<br>They exist and live with little thinking.</p><p>O Pratibimba, life in existence is not binary,<br>It is in the continuum.
So you cannot say this is a living being and that is not.<br>You can say this is more living and another is less.<br>Thus, it does not matter how busy you are and how much you work,<br>when you are working like a machine then you lesser life<br>When you are fully conscious you are more life.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat<br>Yours Truly Hari</p><h1 id=article5215---the-art-of-missing-life>Article5215 : The Art Of Missing Life<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5215---the-art-of-missing-life aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Tags: [Philosophy, My Views, Life]</p><h1 id=the-art-of-missing-life>The Art Of Missing Life<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-art-of-missing-life aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>You take a photograph of a bird,<br>data is in your camera and the bird has flown.<br>You take a photograph of a river,<br>data is in your camera, and the water has gone away.<br>You listen to a music performance, music is recorded.<br>Data is on the storage device but the musician has gone.<br>You smell a breeze coming from a flower,<br>you experienced the smell but the flower is far away.</p><p>Photographs and recorded music are data,<br>it is stored on external devices.<br>Photographs, listened words, smell of a flower,<br>touch of your loved one is your experience, etc.,<br>all is all data, and data is stored in your brain.</p><p>People and things exist around you in a certain way. This is the first.<br>Your eyes, ears, nose, etc catch the information<br>about those and store that data. This is always the second.<br>Whatever data is stored in your brain, that data is old data.<br>Data is always old, data is always about the past.<br>In microseconds, milliseconds things change.<br>What is existing before you and<br>what you are seeing inside your brain are two different things.<br>But the miracle of your existence is such that you think both are the same.</p><p>Existence comes first,<br>recording devices and data stored in them come later.<br>What you have in your mind is nothing<br>but data about the world around you.<br>It is nothing more than the data stored on a hard disk.</p><p>You know the photograph of your loved one,<br>which is stored on your computer is not your Loved one.<br>You know the photograph of a river<br>on your computer is not a real river.<br>You know the group photograph of an event<br>on your computer is not the event.<br>You know the photograph of food items<br>on your computer is not real food.<br>Whatever you have on your computer or phone is data.

<strong>REFINE IT</strong><br>The superiority complex of human</p><p>From the human head if you remove the grey cells or neurons then whatever is left to complete body is the animal body.</p><p>We give too much importance to this body without realising that it is not any different from any other animal body.</p><p>This sense of superiority among all living being and not only that since your sense of security among all human being I am the best or I should be the best that I should be the winner or I should be the first or I should be on the top is the human madness. This sense of superiority come to human just because of one part called brain.</p><p>This sense of security is so much that human think god created this world for human. We are here to enjoy and rul other species. Not only that we are here to enjoy over other suffering and others labour and hard work. God has meet me intelligent God has made me king God has made me human being there for I should be special and I must use this opportunity to enjoy the life and be better than other species and other human being.</p><p>Unfortunately if this sense of security is taken away from human being or he feel I am worthless or I am being exploited then human can&rsquo;t live.</p><p>Architectural design of the software in human brain its such that extremely few people can live by knowing the reality that we are nothing here in this existence. Our body is nothing more than the animal body. Creation is not human centric. The creator is not like human being. The creator does not have emotions like human. The creator does not understand the 8000 languages which human created in last 20 or 30000 years. But, there is a creation. How it happened. We don&rsquo;t know. Who did it we don&rsquo;t know. Because of our stupidity complex we can&rsquo;t handle this ignorance there for we try to give the answer the answer which are coming from books or fairy tale stories.</p><p>Human think that he thinks but unfortunately he is repeating the same thoughts which culture or society has given him. Society and culture was built over thousands of year. Therefore it has its own wisdom. But inheriting everything from the society and culture, politicians and religious leaders, artist and scientist, elders and experts and not using your own brain means we are not more than an animal body.</p><h1 id=article5217--smartness-is-foolishness>Article5217 : Smartness is foolishness<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5217--smartness-is-foolishness aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Tags:<br><strong>REFINE IT</strong>
Smartness is foolishness</p><p>Ability to think and imagine is an incredible ability of human race</p><p>We are able to think and evasion about the abstract concepts non existing objects</p><p>Imagining with the help of existing data extrapolating and predicting is great ability. But ability to imagine and think in the absence of data is much greater ability.</p><p>This is why human is intelligent race smart race among all the lives exist on this planet.</p><p>But unfortunate thing is when we imagine about something about which data source is already before you. We don&rsquo;t talk to the people and we imagine about them. And then think our imagination our prediction or forecast about them was correct.</p><p>This act mein Vishva table for intelligence agencies security agencies because they need to protect the society nation therefore they need to think about enemy of the country enemy of the society.</p><p>Unfortunately we use disability even with our close friends relatives independence. Without asking about them we imagine. After asking if our designation is not fitting to the fact we argue with them. This is how relationship get spoiled. We think we are smart we could prempt and think in advance but most of the time in relationship it turns a foolish idea.</p><p>Now you decide in your life you want to be proved as smart and then loose relation and finally look foolish.</p><p>Or look innocent keep relation and remain wise. This all depends relationship with whom. Relationship with wise will never go away no matter what you do relationship with fool is worth going no matter how could you do for them the remain unhappy.</p><h1 id=article5218--the-real-hell-of-false-ego>Article5218 : The Real Hell of False Ego<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#article5218--the-real-hell-of-false-ego aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>Tags: [My Views, Life, Society]</p><h1 id=the-real-hell-of-false-ego>The Real Hell of False Ego<a class=td-heading-self-link href=#the-real-hell-of-false-ego aria-label="Heading self-link"></a></h1><p>As a life, you can have the following feelings about yourself
and each of these serves some purpose
for yourself and the society around you
and causes some harm to you.</p><p>1- In this infinite cosmos, among billions of galaxies,
trillions of stars and planets,
my planet and my life is too insignificant.</p><p>2- In this cosmos my planet is special,
Because it inhabits life in the whole known cosmos,
but I am insignificant among trillions of life on this planet.</p><p>3- On this planet, there are several kinds of lives
but human is a special kind of life
because of our ability to think, reason, imagine, and empathize.
I am human therefore I am special.</p><p>4- On this planet my culture is great
because mine is the older, grandest, wisest.
But I am insignificant,
because I have not learned anything
from my ancestors and the wisdom of my culture.</p><p>5- My culture is great and I am the torch wearer of this culture,
I am a special person from this culture,
I am a guru, a leader, and elder people of my culture
my people should respect and worship me for
my knowledge and my sacrifices.</p><p>6- My culture is great and other cultures lesser great
therefore their people should also respect
my culture and leaders of my culture.</p><p>7- My culture is greatest and I am the leader therefore
all the people of this planet should respect me
and pay taxes as long as they are living on my land.</p><p>When we say our ancestor then
we are willing to go back two or three thousand years back.
But, if we go back to the origin of life
we will find our ancestors are Algae and fungi
and their ancestor is oxygen and the sun.</p><p>As individual human beings, we are nothing here.
As a group of humans, we have tremendous power
which other animals do not have.
As a group, we are a very creative species.
As an individual, we cannot even create simple alpin.</p><p>So culture, religions, societies, villages, nations, etc
are natural and useful creations of humans.
These are not creations of God.
Their diversity of thoughts, cultures, beliefs,
and the way of thinking
that is why we could create so much that we have today.</p><p>In ancient times whether Indian or Greek or Mayan civilizations
could do wonder because of allowing this diversity within their culture.</p><p>In today&rsquo;s time whatever advancement
in science and technology has happened
it is because those nations
who were having wealth
and allowed different thoughts to melt on
their land to create something unique.</p><p>In the process of evolution, every race
developed some unique mental and physical capabilities.
It makes sense to come together to create
something more meaningful for all humans.
As far as other lives are concerned,
humans need not do anything
except don&rsquo;t disturb them or at least disturb them.</p><p>Animals and trees in the forest are smart enough
to take care of themselves
they don&rsquo;t need human help.
But if humans need their help then
we need to reciprocate that help to them.</p><p>Thinking my race is the greatest,
my language is the greatest is good for an individual
because it gives him or her the purpose to fight and live.
This helps you refine and improve yourself and your culture.</p><p>But entering in the war and killing people,
entering into social media space, and abusing and hurting people
to ensure that only my race and my culture should survive on this planet.
That would be dangerous for this planet and humanity.
Because without diversity there is
no growth, refinement, or evolution possible.</p><p>Our belief systems whether we consider this history or not, are great.
They have brought us where are today.
It helps us in experiencing something unique and evolving.
But when we want to have only one belief system,
This monotony is dangerous for the human race.
Because we get quickly bored.</p><p>In public meetings, public platform
before becoming aggressive and attacking others
we should ask ourselves,
Are we looking for monotony or diversity?
A little bit of bad, a little bit of cancer,
and a little of rough weather make the human body and mind strong.
Because the body keeps fighting and the immune system remains active.
Too much makes us sick and we fall ill.
But how much is too much you need to decide.</p><p>Hari Om Tat Sat
