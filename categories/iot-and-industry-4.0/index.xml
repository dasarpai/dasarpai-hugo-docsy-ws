&lt;p>A digital twin is a &lt;strong>virtual representation&lt;/strong> of a real-world entity or process, created to simulate its behavior and performance. It consists of three main components: representation of the physical entity itself, the digital model that represents it, and the data that links the two (original and twin). Keep in mind the data is generated by model based on the representation of the physical entity. This technology allows users to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of physical objects or systems in real-time by providing insights based on data collected from sensors and IoT devices [1][2][3].&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
