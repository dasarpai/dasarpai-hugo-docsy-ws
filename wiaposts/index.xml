&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shri Rudram&lt;/strong> (श्रीरुद्रम्) is a Vedic mantra or chant dedicated to Rudra, a form of Shiva. It is part of the Krishna Yajurveda&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Taittiriya Samhita&lt;/em> (TS 4.5 and 4.7). In the Shukla Yajurveda, it appears in Chapters 16 and 18. Shri Rudram is composed of two sections: the &lt;strong>Namakam&lt;/strong> (also called &lt;em>Rudra Prashna&lt;/em>) and the &lt;strong>Chamakam&lt;/strong> (also known as &lt;em>Chamaka Prashna&lt;/em>). This text holds great significance in Shaivism, where Shiva is revered as &lt;em>Parabrahman&lt;/em>, the Supreme Being.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ayurveda Tips in Sanskrit Texts</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/ayurveda-tips-in-sanskrit-texts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/ayurveda-tips-in-sanskrit-texts/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5297-ayurveda-tips-in-sanskrit-texts.jpg" alt="Ayurveda Tips in Sanskrit Texts">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From our experience we say&lt;br>
Doing transaction of any kind &lt;br>
Whether social, commercial, religious &lt;br>
We need another &lt;br>
But if we don&amp;rsquo;t know about another &lt;br>
Then transaction can be risky &lt;br>
It can cause pain, hurt, loss or suffering &lt;br>
Therefore don&amp;rsquo;t transact with unknown. &lt;br>

&lt;p>In my view, the distinction between &lt;strong>Ahamkaara&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Ego&lt;/strong> is subtle yet profound, especially when viewed from a philosophical and spiritual lens. Ahamkara is &lt;strong>a tool that can be refined&lt;/strong>, whereas ego is &lt;strong>an illusion that must be dissolved&lt;/strong>. If Ahamkara leads to the realization that &lt;strong>all is one&lt;/strong>, it becomes a stepping stone to enlightenment. But if it binds one to the material world, it becomes just another name for ego.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Prakriti in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5293-meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Prakriti in Bhagwat Gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Sanskrit word Prakriti or Prakruti has multiple meanings and is used in the Bhagavad Gita in different contexts. In the English language, we try to translate it to &amp;ldquo;Nature&amp;rdquo;. But, does this word really summarize the meaning of the Sanskrit word?

&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;यज्ञ&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Yagnya or Yajnya), which closely translates to &amp;ldquo;sacrifice&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a Western sense, it refers to sacrificing or offering something very dear to you to a higher power, God, or a higher cause. In Vedanta, though, it carries multiple meanings, and without understanding Vedic culture and context, one cannot fully grasp this word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Word Knowledge or Gyan or Jnyana in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5286-meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;ज्ञान&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Gyan or Jnyana), which translates to &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a worldly sense, when we talk about knowledge, we usually refer to information about something—generally objects, people, processes, or events around us. Sometimes, it also refers to our own body; for a slightly deeper thinker, it includes the mind and ego as well. But for a spiritual seeker, this &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is not an external thing or &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; at all but the Self.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bhagwat Gita Oneliner Lessons Chapterwise</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5285-bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise.jpg" alt="Bhagwat Gita Oneliner Lessons Chapterwise">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu scripture, consists of 18 chapters, each addressing different aspects of life, duty, and spirituality through the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to daily read, connect, assimilate, and practice the teachings, then these 18 lines can help you to start with.

&lt;p>In the Bhagavad Gita, the terms related to &amp;ldquo;soul&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; such as आत्मा (ātmā), मात्मनः (mātmanaḥ), मात्मा (mātmā), यात्मा (yātmā), and similar variations derived from the Sanskrit root ātman are used in various sense and meaning depends upon the context. Thinking Atma means always soul or Jiva is incorrect. The word ātman fundamentally refers to the &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; but its meaning shifts based on the philosophical and practical context within the text. Krishna, as the divine teacher, employs ātman to convey multiple layers of understanding—ranging from the physical body to the eternal, imperishable essence—reflecting the text&amp;rsquo;s deep metaphysical framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Hindi the Mother of All North Indian Languages?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/is-hindi-mother-of-all-north-indian-languages/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/is-hindi-mother-of-all-north-indian-languages/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5280-Is-Hindi-Mother-of-All-North-Indian-Languages.jpg" alt="Is Hindi Mother of All North Indian Languages?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Long ago, when I completed the study of Prasthantrai (comprising the ten cardinal Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutra), it opened my eyes to world religions and diverse philosophical concepts. I delved into it under the Advaita Vedanta school of Philosophy (Darshana), and it took a significant amount of time to align with the ideas presented in Advaita Vedanta. Contemplating on this, I felt the urge to write and reflect upon my thoughts. In the meantime, I explored other world religions, delving into their histories and geographies where they rise and grown. Based on my understanding, I compiled the following tables to illustrate the unique characteristics of each religion. It became evident to me that all religions are distinct. In this article I am emphasizing the need to comprehend the various parameters and belief systems of each religion. I hope this will help all people including religious, secular and atheist. To facilitate comparison and avoid confusion, I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined the major belief systems of the five main religions/faith/systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Definitions of Holi people</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/Definition-of-Holi-people/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/Definition-of-Holi-people/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5248-Definition-of-Holi-people-institutions.jpg" alt="Definition of Holi people">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I notice that people often use these terms very loosely without understanding their underlying meanings. Additionally, when I engage in defining these terms, many individuals adopt the &amp;ldquo;all are the same&amp;rdquo; philosophy. They employ the same old, meaningless logic that all gods are the same. Unfortunately, they fail to grasp the distinction between &amp;ldquo;Devta&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; concluding that since there are many &amp;ldquo;devatas,&amp;rdquo; there must be many gods. This Western mindset hinders the understanding of Bhartiya culture and often leads to fruitless arguments. In this article, I attempt to define some key terms based on my understanding of the Sanatana Knowledge system. You are most welcome to improve these definitions if necessary. I hope this helps my readers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Upanishads</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/Introduction-to-Upanishads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2024 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/Introduction-to-Upanishads/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5247-Introduction-to-Upanishads.jpg" alt="Introduction to Upanishads">&lt;/p>

&lt;li>A table or dataset is generally means same thing. Ideally a dataset can have multiple tables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A table contains numerous columns.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A table or dataset contains information, this can pertain to either a sample or a population.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Samples represent a subset of observations, while populations encompass all observations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Census methods gather data for the entire population, whereas surveys collect data for a sample.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Statistics involve collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data, incorporating methods for both sample and population data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A census involves a comprehensive count of an entire population, aiming to collect data from every individual or element in a specific group or area, leaving none out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Information about samples or populations is available in the rows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Column data within a table exhibits specific distributions dependent on the data type (e.g., numerical, categorical) and column name (e.g., gender, city, age, wait time, population, etc.).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mean, mode, median, standard deviation, range, min, max, quartile, etc., are referred to as measures or metrics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There exist six categories of statistical measures: 1) Measures of Central Tendency, 2) Measures of Dispersion or Variability, 3) Measures of Position, 4) Measures of Shape or Distribution, 5) Measures of Association, 6) Measures of Association.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Statistics summarize tables using measures such as mean, mode, median, standard deviation, range, min, max, quartile, applicable to either sample or population data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Parameters, including mean, mode, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, etc., describe the characteristics of a population dataset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In cases where census data isn&amp;rsquo;t available, knowledge about the population parameters is unavailable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inferential statistics involve deducing population insights from sample data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Non-parametric&amp;rdquo; refers to scenarios where parameters (such as mean, mode, median, etc.) are unknown, indicating a lack of population data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lack of knowledge implies insufficient data for calculation, not the absence of prior data analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Statistical tests evaluate whether two datasets (columns) belong to the same population by comparing variances or statistics between sample data and population data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; is a broad term in statistics, encompassing columns, column summaries, individual cell values, and context-specific references to both sample and population data. It includes various forms like voice recordings, images, articles, emails, logs, streaming or batch data. Clarify the specific type of data when discussing it.&lt;/li>

Fortunately the human mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way and the message is still not gone. See around how many holy books, Guru-Vaakya, best selling books, are existing.

&lt;p>People Question Rama, why he left Sita because someone questioned Sita&amp;rsquo;s character? Rama should have defended and continued as king.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you remember once Uma took the form of Sita to test the divinity of Rama. But, just because Shiva had seen Sita in Uma for a short time, he denounced Uma as wife and said you are my Mother now because Rama is my Aradhya. Such are the ideals in Hinduism. Post this event she went to her father&amp;rsquo;s house and in some incident jumped into fire. Shiva became disturbed and he destroyed Yagnya of Daksha. He carried Uma on her shoulders for many years and finally Vishnu cut the dead body into pieces. Post this Shiva goes to long Meditation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Earlier Hindu Institutions and Today's Society</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/earlier-hindu-institutions-and-todays-society/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/earlier-hindu-institutions-and-todays-society/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5175-Earlier-Hindu-Institutions-And-Todays-Society.jpg" alt="Earlier Hindu Institutions and Today’s Society">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The definition of friendship in real life is not the same as in social media. In the age of social media Connecting relatives, colleagues, like minded people is considered friendship. It has its own utility. Having relationships like spouse, children, parents, uncle, aunt doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean friendship. Friendship is a special relationship. In every life very few relations deserve to qualify for that special friendship. Otherwise all are transactions of give and take depending upon time, place, and situation. The role of people can change from squeezer to squeezed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Maya 2</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/understanding-maya-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/understanding-maya-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5166-Understanding-Maya-2.jpg" alt="Understanding Maya 2">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Normally people think love is between opposite genders. &lt;br>
Some people think love is about sex. &lt;br>
There are enough minds who don’t perceive &lt;br>
any difference between this four-letter word &lt;br>

You know what I mean. &lt;br>
Other people say I love shopping. &lt;br>

&lt;p>Faith can move mountains, but faith should be well-founded, &lt;br>
and you should be able to wait for enough. &lt;br>
If the faith in something moves mountains someday then &lt;br>
it doesn’t mean the object on which have faith has done that miracle. &lt;br>
It also means that you have the power to move mountains. &lt;br>
Act may be physical or mental. &lt;br>
Your emotions have the power &lt;br>
to synchronize with the vibration of the mountain &lt;br>
and when you both are in sync &lt;br>
you can create constructive or destructive patterns of waves &lt;br>
and either smash the mountain, move it or invert it. &lt;br>
It looks impossible in classical physics, &lt;br>
but from quantum physics, all this is possible. &lt;br>
The only thing is, we don’t know enough about &lt;br>
how to control and be in sync with the cosmos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Universal Constants</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-constants/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-constants/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5137-Universal-Constants.jpg" alt="Universal Constants">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, &lt;strong>there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial&lt;/strong>, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Equation Of Arjunas Arrows</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/equation-of-arjunas-arrows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/equation-of-arjunas-arrows/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5133-Equation-Of-Arjunas-Arrows.jpg" alt="Equation Of Arjunas Arrows">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tantra means system. (like Lok-Tantra, Praja-Tantra etc) &lt;br>
Mantra means sound which contains secret, powerful energy. &lt;br>
Yantra means tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indian Tantra school &lt;br>
(a school that uses a system or collection of systems) &lt;br>
helps in creating tools (Yantra). &lt;br>
This yantra may be of Devi (female), &lt;br>
Devta (female) yantra. &lt;br>
Theoretically, I believe it is possible &lt;br>
to create neutral Yantra as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Who Is Really Sleeping?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/who-is-really-sleeping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/who-is-really-sleeping/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5086-Who-Is-Really-Sleeping.jpg" alt="Who Is Really Sleeping?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As per the law of physics all the planets, stars and galaxies &lt;br>
want to go in a straight line &lt;br>
but it is a gravitational force due to which they start rotating. &lt;br>
But they are not aware that they are rotating. Are they? &lt;br>
For humans also the same thing applies. &lt;br>
But, human knows, he is in a circle &lt;br>
and it is not possible to break the circle. &lt;br>
Therefore instead of looking at purpose in a straight line &lt;br>
he looks at the purpose in a circular motion. &lt;br>
This circular motion is created &lt;br>
by another kind of gravitational force in life, &lt;br>
you can call it love, greed, attachment, attraction, desire, etc. &lt;br>
Ancient scripture throws upon us an idea of Liberation, Moksha. &lt;br>
It means freedom from the eternal endless circle. &lt;br>
But, what does that mean? &lt;br>
Going infinitely in a straight line like planets can go without gravity? &lt;br>
Or not going anywhere? &lt;br>
Or be everywhere? &lt;br>
Or completely destroy and be one with the cosmos? &lt;br>
Ignorantly many people think that is another kind of joy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Concept Of Yoga</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5067-The-Concept-Of-Yoga.jpg" alt="The Concept Of Yoga">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept &lt;br>
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society. &lt;br>
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit &lt;br>
among the employees, investors &amp;amp; other stakeholders. &lt;br>
But should consider society around &lt;br>
as an integral part of their existence to survive. &lt;br>
But why should any corporate do this CSR program? &lt;br>
Because they are large fish in the pond &lt;br>
therefore they should show compassion to the others &lt;br>
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together &lt;br>
otherwise, they themselves will in danger? &lt;br>
Because society has given the platform to perform &lt;br>
therefore they should reciprocate? &lt;br>
Because they should comply with government regulations? &lt;br>
Because they will get more name and fame &lt;br>
as a compassionate organization &lt;br>
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further &lt;br>
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future? &lt;br>
Any sensible person need to understand &lt;br>
no one can exist longer in isolation, &lt;br>
so it is about the entire ecosystem. &lt;br>
In an ecosystem every individual &lt;br>
no matter how small they are &lt;br>
they play some significant role. &lt;br>
If you try to manipulate the system &lt;br>
and alter some element of the ecosystem &lt;br>
then there are consequences of it. &lt;br>
By doing so either you change &lt;br>
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair &lt;br>
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power For Prayer</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-power-for-prayer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-power-for-prayer/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5055-The-Power-For-Prayer.jpg" alt="The Power For Prayer">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>One, who are common human.&lt;/strong> &lt;br>
Their whole time and energy are for their personal or nearest or dearest people. &lt;br>
Busy in day to day work. Some take the comfort of life so seriously that they are too busy earning for the comforts. &lt;br>
Some are not skilled or not having the right opportunity but still too busy with whatever they have in hand. &lt;br>

&lt;p>Responsibility is a Noun. But it takes birth from a verb “ability”. &lt;br>

&lt;p>Who is that living being who cannot respond? &lt;br>
Only dead cannot respond! &lt;br>
The question is about choice. &lt;br>
To something, we want to respond to some others not. &lt;br>
