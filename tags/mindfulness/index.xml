&lt;p>Compulsiveness is slavery. Generally people people confuse this with their freedom.&lt;/p>

And let others know what unjust has happened to me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is The Waking State Of Life?</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-the-waking-state-of-life/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-the-waking-state-of-life/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5102-What-Is-The-Waking-State-Of-Life.jpg" alt="What Is The Waking State Of Life?">&lt;/p>
