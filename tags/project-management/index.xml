&lt;p>Recently I was watching a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5ZQv0aHVgys">video&lt;/a> about entrepreneurship. This was going viral and people were appreciating the talk. I wanted to analyze and understand what the speaker wants to say, what people are understanding, and what should be learning from the talk. I wrote a paragraph on this, but very soon I realized this deserves more contemplation and an article. In that process, I ended up writing this article. I hope you will get some more insights. Many of you may have different insights and different perspectives, so don’t forget to share your perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>20 Reasons Why AI Project Fails</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/20-Reasons-Why-AI-Project-Fails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 15:50:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/20-Reasons-Why-AI-Project-Fails/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/dspost/dsp6007-Why-AI-Project-Fails.jpg" alt="Why AI Project Fails">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>PMI ACP exam&lt;/strong> expects from a candidate who is appearing for the exam that he must understand the following topics. It is an exhaustive check of the knowledge, skills, and attitude. This is the reason I love and value this certificate most over other methodology specific certification of the Agile world. This is best for the both coach level and the introduction level. At the introduction level, it helps a team in understanding what is agile in nutshell. At the coach level, it helps the coach to select the best-suited practices for any organization’s need.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Structure of Business Dialogues</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Structure-of-Business-Dialogues/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 16:23:16 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Structure-of-Business-Dialogues/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1029-Structure-of-Dialogue-min.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is speaking? How to be an efficient and effective speaker? Everybody who can open his mouth has a tongue and a healthy vocal cord can speak. But, is everybody able to communicate effectively and achieve the objective of speaking? In this world where we have around 7000 &lt;a href="https://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/fire/naclo/pages/Ling/Fact/num-languages.html">languages&lt;/a>, we had &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-wars-have-been-fought-in-the-last-5000-years">millions &lt;/a>of wars in the last 5000 years of human civilization. Why? Because there are very few effective communicators and none is effective communicator all the time in his personal, social, and business life. Simply opening a mouth and uttering something is not an effective talking or speaking. When one opens mouth and utters unrecognizable words then it is called noise. When one opens mouth and utters sensible words with meaningful sentences it is called speech. The word “speech” is a noun. The process through which we deliver a speech is called “speak”. The word “speak” is a verb. There are many names for this “speech” and “speak”. It depends upon various parameters like below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Balanced Score Card</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Understanding-Balanced-Score-Card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 11:14:08 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Understanding-Balanced-Score-Card/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1028-Balance-Scorecard-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

Dimension is something which can be used for filtering, grouping purpose like department name, employee name, location, severity, priority, etc. The measure is something on which you can perform mathematical and statistical operations like average, sum, minimum, max, etc. Like salary, delay, time to solve a problem, number of tickets, travel expenses, fees, revenue, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interpersonal Skills for a project manager</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Interpersonal-Skills-for-a-project-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 13:12:10 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Interpersonal-Skills-for-a-project-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1027-Softskills-Project-Manger-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To succeed in any profession you need to strike a balance between the art and science of that profession. Science is about processes, practices, techniques, tools, logic, etc. But art is about knowing what else is required to complete the work. It works as a glue between isolated steps, techniques, stages, processes, or practices. To play a melodious guitar we need to ensure strings are not too tight neither too loose. Knowing this balance is art. It is not about measuring the tension of string using some tool but listening to the sound after striking the cord. What combination of color, what stroke, and in what direction will improve the painting is about art. The project management profession is no exception to this art. This is what generally referred to as the Nontechnical skills of the project manager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Team Challenge</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 13:08:54 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1024-Challenge-Team-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Karthik is working with the current company for the last 12 years. By virtue of his hard work and initiative, the company has done good progress in the last few years. In reward of this Karthik was also progressing in his career and now he is in a leadership position within the organization. Karthik is a master of his subject and a detail-oriented person. Once he takes work in hand he gets it done by putting in all his efforts and resources at his disposal. The &lt;strong>biggest challenge before Karthik is his own time management&lt;/strong>. He always wants to remain in the driving seat. Because of this attitude, too many people depend upon him and waiting for his time. He has his team of good people but they depend upon Karthik for every small and big decision. Recently Karthik started crashing because of the time required to make all decisions. The team is very happy with Karthik. They appreciate Karthik’s work style, knowledge, attitude, but Karthik wants to delegate some work to his team members and he is not happy with the current attitude of team members.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project Manager Responsibilities</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Project-Manager-Responsibilities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 09:14:38 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Project-Manager-Responsibilities/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1017-Responsibilties-of-Project-Manager-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A project manager is a person accountable for accomplishing the project objectives. The project objectives are defined by project stakeholders and they are negotiated and agreed upon with the project manager. Project objectives are related to either of these 6 aspects namely cost, quality, time, benefits, risk, and scope. PMI sees the term “Project Manager” as a “Professional” like Engineer, Doctor, Lawyer, etc. But the industry looks at this term as role or designation. In the eyes of PMI, you may be a project manager within your organization but if you are not rendering project management services to the organization then you are not a project manager. Other times you may not be a designated project manager within the organization but you are rendering project management services for the organization then you are a project manager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Measure Project Success Criteria</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/How-to-Measure-Project-Success-Criteria/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:13:56 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/How-to-Measure-Project-Success-Criteria/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1016-Project_Success_Criteria.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You ask yourself how many years you have been in project management? How many times you were waiting for a long to get the start of an exciting new project? How many times did you want to close an existing stressful project and want to start a new project on the new team? Many times due to the excitement of the new project we just focus on the project team, deliverables, technology, project duration, and cost. We create our project plan and our team starts working on the new project and again the same problem starts surfacing which was happening in our previous project! One of the main cause of that is we do not spend enough time to understand who are the different stakeholders and what is the meaning of project success from the point of view.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Waterfall Methodology vs Agile</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Waterfall-Methodology-vs-Agile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 08:51:34 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Waterfall-Methodology-vs-Agile/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1015-Agile-Waterfall-min.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The data points below are related to Software Development State of Art in America. You can imagine what may be happening in other part of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>United States spends more than $250 billion each year on IT application development of approximately 175,000 projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>31.1% of projects will be canceled before they ever get completed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>52.7% of projects will cost 189% of their original estimates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The lost opportunity costs are not measurable, but could easily be in the trillions of dollars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The failure to produce reliable software to handle baggage at the new Denver airport is costing the city $1.1 million per day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On average only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on time and on-budget&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42% of the originally-proposed features and functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projects completed by the smaller American companies A total of 78.4% of their software projects will get deployed with at least 74.2% of their original features and functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>48% of the IT executives in the research sample feel that there are more failures currently than just five years ago&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time overrun: The average overrun is 222% of the original time estimate. For large companies, the average is 230%; for medium companies, the average is 202%; and for small companies, the average is 239%.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost overrun: The average across all companies is 189% of the original cost estimate. The average cost overrun is 178% for large companies, 182% for medium companies, and 214% for small companies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Features and functions: On average, only 61% of originally specified features and functions were available on these projects. Large companies have the worst record with only 42% of the features and functions in the end product. For medium companies, the percentage is 65%. And for small companies, the percentage is 74%.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Project is an instrument of change. Hence during the project lifecycle changes are inevitable. Therefore &lt;strong>Change Request in Project Management&lt;/strong> is an extremely important process in any project. Uncertainties in a project can be managed by using the concept of “Progressive Elaboration” and “Rolling Wave Planning” techniques. As a project manager, you must understand that how much agility is affordable and acceptable. For example in a one-year-long project, if you decide that you will make only a monthly plan and not anything beyond this period (because many things can change in one year period), then what is the guarantee that this one-month plan will not change during execution? Absolutely no guarantee!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behaviors that lead to Exceptional Performance</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Behaviors-that-lead-to-Exceptional-Performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 14:40:58 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Behaviors-that-lead-to-Exceptional-Performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1001-Exceptional-Performance-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
