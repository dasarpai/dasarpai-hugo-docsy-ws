&lt;p>When we say nowadays the surrounding is corrupt,&lt;br>
we need to ask: where does this surrounding start?&lt;br>
At my heart, skin, bedroom, flat, apartment, district, state, etc.?&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves how we reached the conclusion&lt;br>
that it was not corrupt earlier.&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves what we are doing,&lt;br>
apart from adding to that corruption at our own level.&lt;br>
If I am not part of the solution,&lt;br>
then there is a high chance I am part of the problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to know the truth?</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/How-to-know-the-truth/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/How-to-know-the-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5267-How-to-know-the-truth.jpg" alt="How to Know the Truth?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Things around us are not full of life or lifeless.&lt;br>
These are two opposites.&lt;br>
This philosophy leads to duality or dichotomy.&lt;br>
Everything which exists has life. How much life?&lt;br>
Before that, we need to understand what life is?&lt;br>
That which takes birth, decay, gets rusted or sick, becomes old, and dies is a life.&lt;br>
Because it has a lifecycle from birth to death.&lt;br>
Based on your interaction with things and the world around&lt;br>
you can consider something less life&lt;br>
and some as more life&lt;br>

it has nothing to do with the objectivity of life or life as it exists in the cosmos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are You Feeling Stuck in Life</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/Are-You-Feeling-Stuck-in-Life/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/Are-You-Feeling-Stuck-in-Life/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5207-Are-You-Feeling-Stuck-in-Life.jpg" alt="Classical Literature">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The definition of friendship in real life is not the same as in social media. In the age of social media Connecting relatives, colleagues, like minded people is considered friendship. It has its own utility. Having relationships like spouse, children, parents, uncle, aunt doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean friendship. Friendship is a special relationship. In every life very few relations deserve to qualify for that special friendship. Otherwise all are transactions of give and take depending upon time, place, and situation. The role of people can change from squeezer to squeezed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Biggest Mistake</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-biggest-mistake/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-biggest-mistake/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5162-The-Biggest-Mistake.jpg" alt="The Biggest Mistake">&lt;/p>
