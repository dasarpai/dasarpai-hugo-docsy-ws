&lt;li>If there&amp;rsquo;s any part of you that believes in any kind of a higher Divinity?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Would you have rather seen Kamala Harris become president?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you had to design the ideal American president, could you give us a list of points in terms of that person&amp;rsquo;s personality and that person&amp;rsquo;s mission?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Would you say that the onus lies with people like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, people who are central in the world of tech, to come up with ideas related to keeping the future of the human race safe?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What exactly does everyone need to know about AI?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you believe that India is kind of going back to that reality of becoming Vishwa Guru?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is your opinion on PM Narendra Modi?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do you think media content, these things, have a role to play in spreading the message of peace, the message of love?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What would be your message for those next people who will take the baton from you?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will meditation on a global scale lead to human evolution?&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>USA Under Trump:&lt;/strong> Harari describes Trump as a leader focused on power without regard for truth, which could make the USA more isolated and truth-averse. He warns of the potential for the U.S. to use its power unwisely under Trump’s leadership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ideal American President:&lt;/strong> Harari refrains from prescribing characteristics for an ideal president, citing his lack of political expertise, but emphasizes that a president should have a global perspective, considering both U.S. interests and those of humanity, especially regarding AI and the climate crisis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Opinion on PM Narendra Modi:&lt;/strong> Harari is cautious about making judgments without deep knowledge but expresses disappointment over India’s non-committal stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, expecting a leader from a historically anti-imperialist country to take a strong stand.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dangers and Management of AI:&lt;/strong> Harari discusses the unprecedented power of AI, distinguishing it from other technologies due to its capacity to make decisions and innovate independently. He expresses concern over AI evolving beyond human control and influencing global power dynamics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Responsibility in AI Development:&lt;/strong> He critiques the race to develop AI without adequate safety measures, citing the lack of trust among global competitors as a major risk, and calls for a global understanding and regulatory framework.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Meditation and Human Evolution:&lt;/strong> Harari advocates for meditation as a tool for achieving personal clarity and truth but doubts its scalability as a global solution due to its inherent challenges and the potential for ritualization without understanding.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Spiritual Depth:&lt;/strong> He values spiritual depth and insists that true spiritual connections should manifest in actions rather than just words. Harari criticizes the use of religious or spiritual claims to justify negative or aggressive behaviors.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Role of Media:&lt;/strong> Harari believes that media plays a crucial role in shaping societal attitudes towards peace and love, advocating for content that presents a balanced view of reality, inclusive of its complexities and challenges.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Genetic Engineering:&lt;/strong> He discusses the potential social divisions that could result from genetic enhancements being accessible only to the wealthy, leading to a split in human capabilities and societal stratification.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Personal Impact of Meditation:&lt;/strong> He credits meditation with providing the mental clarity needed to write his books and understand complex historical and technological trends deeply.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>As a public intellectual, Yuval Noah Harari often points out ideal scenarios (global collaboration, trust, deep inner work) while simultaneously acknowledging systemic barriers that make these ideals difficult to achieve at scale. The contradictions don’t necessarily undermine his perspective but do highlight the real complexity and unresolved tensions in seeking global solutions. Many of these critiques/contradictions stem from broader philosophical and real political tensions like&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Beginning of Infinity</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/booksummary/The-Beginning-of-Infinity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/booksummary/The-Beginning-of-Infinity/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/booksummary/7541-The-Beginning-of-Infinity.jpg" alt="The Beginning of Infinity">&lt;/p>

we need to ask: where does this surrounding start?&lt;br>
At my heart, skin, bedroom, flat, apartment, district, state, etc.?&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves how we reached the conclusion&lt;br>

We need to ask ourselves what we are doing,&lt;br>
apart from adding to that corruption at our own level.&lt;br>

Before that, we need to understand what life is?&lt;br>
That which takes birth, decay, gets rusted or sick, becomes old, and dies is a life.&lt;br>
Because it has a lifecycle from birth to death.&lt;br>

&lt;p>Faith can move mountains, but faith should be well-founded, &lt;br>
and you should be able to wait for enough. &lt;br>
If the faith in something moves mountains someday then &lt;br>
it doesn’t mean the object on which have faith has done that miracle. &lt;br>
It also means that you have the power to move mountains. &lt;br>
Act may be physical or mental. &lt;br>
Your emotions have the power &lt;br>
to synchronize with the vibration of the mountain &lt;br>
and when you both are in sync &lt;br>
you can create constructive or destructive patterns of waves &lt;br>
and either smash the mountain, move it or invert it. &lt;br>
It looks impossible in classical physics, &lt;br>
but from quantum physics, all this is possible. &lt;br>
The only thing is, we don’t know enough about &lt;br>
how to control and be in sync with the cosmos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Choose Your Attitude</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/choose-your-attitude/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/choose-your-attitude/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5132-Choose-Your-Attitude.jpg" alt="Choose Your Attitude">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As per the law of physics all the planets, stars and galaxies &lt;br>
want to go in a straight line &lt;br>
but it is a gravitational force due to which they start rotating. &lt;br>
But they are not aware that they are rotating. Are they? &lt;br>
For humans also the same thing applies. &lt;br>
But, human knows, he is in a circle &lt;br>
and it is not possible to break the circle. &lt;br>
Therefore instead of looking at purpose in a straight line &lt;br>
he looks at the purpose in a circular motion. &lt;br>
This circular motion is created &lt;br>
by another kind of gravitational force in life, &lt;br>
you can call it love, greed, attachment, attraction, desire, etc. &lt;br>
Ancient scripture throws upon us an idea of Liberation, Moksha. &lt;br>
It means freedom from the eternal endless circle. &lt;br>
But, what does that mean? &lt;br>
Going infinitely in a straight line like planets can go without gravity? &lt;br>
Or not going anywhere? &lt;br>
Or be everywhere? &lt;br>
Or completely destroy and be one with the cosmos? &lt;br>
Ignorantly many people think that is another kind of joy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Concept Of Six Sins</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-six-sins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-six-sins/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5066-The-Concept-Of-Six-Sins.jpg" alt="The Concept Of Six Sins">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept &lt;br>
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society. &lt;br>
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit &lt;br>
among the employees, investors &amp;amp; other stakeholders. &lt;br>
But should consider society around &lt;br>
as an integral part of their existence to survive. &lt;br>
But why should any corporate do this CSR program? &lt;br>
Because they are large fish in the pond &lt;br>
therefore they should show compassion to the others &lt;br>
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together &lt;br>
otherwise, they themselves will in danger? &lt;br>
Because society has given the platform to perform &lt;br>
therefore they should reciprocate? &lt;br>
Because they should comply with government regulations? &lt;br>
Because they will get more name and fame &lt;br>
as a compassionate organization &lt;br>
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further &lt;br>
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future? &lt;br>
Any sensible person need to understand &lt;br>
no one can exist longer in isolation, &lt;br>
so it is about the entire ecosystem. &lt;br>
In an ecosystem every individual &lt;br>
no matter how small they are &lt;br>
they play some significant role. &lt;br>
If you try to manipulate the system &lt;br>
and alter some element of the ecosystem &lt;br>
then there are consequences of it. &lt;br>
By doing so either you change &lt;br>
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair &lt;br>
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning From The Nature</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/learning-from-the-nature/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/learning-from-the-nature/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5053-Learning-From-The-Nature.jpg" alt="Learning From The Nature">&lt;/p>
