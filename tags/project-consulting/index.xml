&lt;p>Different stakeholders have different expectations from Agile Project Management. Which benefits me and I need not to pay any price for it is our typical definition of agile. We forget to understand that agile is not chaos. Agile project management enables the ability to respond to the change. Change may happen due to any reason but development team, product owner &amp;amp; manager all together are responsible to manage the change. It is not easy for any organization to adapt this huge change in the work culture. Going away from regular full-blown big bang planning, micro-management of resource, heroism, anti-team appraisal systems, age-old proven complex processes, organization bureaucracy etc is not a joke at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMO Setup</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/management/pmo-setup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/management/pmo-setup/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmlogy/pmc521-pmo-setup.jpg" alt="Pmo Setup">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today businesses are focusing on core competencies and outsourcing those functions which are not their core-competence. They are exploiting all type of resources available to the full extent, equipping core functions with talented staff, efficient material, training, automated systems and fine tune processes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
