&lt;p>The Iliad was written by Homer, an ancient Greek poet. The Iliad is a long epic poem written in 24 books (sections). It contains over 15,000 lines of verse in dactylic hexameter (a rhythmic style of poetry). Originally, it was recited or sung by bards before being written down. The Trojan War (c. 1200 BCE) may have happened, but we have no solid proof. Archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered ruins in Troy (modern-day Turkey) in the 19th century, suggesting a war-like event occurred.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
