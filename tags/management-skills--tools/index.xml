&lt;p>To succeed in any profession you need to strike a balance between the art and science of that profession. Science is about processes, practices, techniques, tools, logic, etc. But art is about knowing what else is required to complete the work. It works as a glue between isolated steps, techniques, stages, processes, or practices. To play a melodious guitar we need to ensure strings are not too tight neither too loose. Knowing this balance is art. It is not about measuring the tension of string using some tool but listening to the sound after striking the cord. What combination of color, what stroke, and in what direction will improve the painting is about art. The project management profession is no exception to this art. This is what generally referred to as the Nontechnical skills of the project manager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Team Challenge</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 13:08:54 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1024-Challenge-Team-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Karthik is working with the current company for the last 12 years. By virtue of his hard work and initiative, the company has done good progress in the last few years. In reward of this Karthik was also progressing in his career and now he is in a leadership position within the organization. Karthik is a master of his subject and a detail-oriented person. Once he takes work in hand he gets it done by putting in all his efforts and resources at his disposal. The &lt;strong>biggest challenge before Karthik is his own time management&lt;/strong>. He always wants to remain in the driving seat. Because of this attitude, too many people depend upon him and waiting for his time. He has his team of good people but they depend upon Karthik for every small and big decision. Recently Karthik started crashing because of the time required to make all decisions. The team is very happy with Karthik. They appreciate Karthik’s work style, knowledge, attitude, but Karthik wants to delegate some work to his team members and he is not happy with the current attitude of team members.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMBOK 5 Process Groups &amp; Processes (Acronyms)</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/PMBOK-5-Process-Groups-Processes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 08:11:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/PMBOK-5-Process-Groups-Processes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1010-PMBOK5.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These acronyms are constructed by me and I use them in my workshop to help participants to practice faster by writing. If you draw a complete table 5 times while speaking louder it will register in your mind. Process names are long therefore I recommend people to use these acronyms if it helps them practicing fast. It is recommended you practice 5 times in different sitting and not in one go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Behaviors that lead to Exceptional Performance</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Behaviors-that-lead-to-Exceptional-Performance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 14:40:58 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Behaviors-that-lead-to-Exceptional-Performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1001-Exceptional-Performance-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
