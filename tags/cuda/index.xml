&lt;p>Tensorflow, pytorch are deep learning libraries or packages. Tensorflow is developed by google and pytorch is developed by Meta. There are some other but these are the most popular one among Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineers. If you are doing anything significant in NLP, computer vision, voice processing you must have used this library. But the power of the these libraries lies in parallel metrics/tensor computation. For that they use hardwardes like GPU or TPU which has thousands of core and they designed purely for metrics/tensor processing. Intially they were used for gaming purpose but with the surge of AI these machines are in high use and used for model training and inference purpose.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
