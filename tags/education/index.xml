&lt;p>In the winter session of 2024 of the Indian Parliament, the government responded about the VRS (Voluntary Retirement Scheme) of 850 IRS (Indian Revenue Service) officers, since 2014. I thought let me share my analysis on it. Not only the revenue service but any government job is not that attractive in India as it was before 1991 or before 2014. Here are my observations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>White-Paper-on-Indian-Economy</title><link>https://localhost:1313/gk/White-Paper-on-Indian-Economy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/gk/White-Paper-on-Indian-Economy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/gk/7008-White-Paper-on-Indian-Economy.jpg" alt="White-Paper-on-Indian-Economy">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This article trying to help you understand&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why Solstice and Makarsankranti doesn&amp;rsquo;t happens on the same day?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are different movement or rotation of earth?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why there are many seasons on the earth?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In sanskrit Divas is always 24 hours. Duration of day (Din) and night (Raatri) varies every day and it depends upon sunrise and sunset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solstice (अयनांत = अयन + अंत), Equinox (विषुव)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Equinox - An event when day and night are of equal duration. It happens on 20/21-Mar and 22/23-Sep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solstice - An event when day is the longest or night is the longest. In northern hemisphere, day is longest on 20/21-Jun, Night is longest on 21/22-Dec.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The word &amp;ldquo;tropic&amp;rdquo; refers to a region of the Earth where the Sun appears directly overhead at least once during the year, causing the Sun to be at its highest point in the sky at noon. There are two main tropics:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tropic of Cancer (Karka): This is the northernmost circle of latitude on Earth where the Sun can appear directly overhead at least once during the year. It&amp;rsquo;s located at approximately 23.5 degrees north of the equator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tropic of Capricorn (Makar): This is the southernmost circle of latitude on Earth where the Sun can appear directly overhead at least once during the year. It&amp;rsquo;s located at approximately 23.5 degrees south of the equator.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is Spring (Vasant) in the north hemisphere there is Autumn (Patjhad/fall) in the south and vice versa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patjhad of Bharat = Fall of USA = Autumn of other English speaking countries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no relationship between Tropic of Cancer (Karka) and Karka Raashi (Cancer Zodiac sign) and Tropic of Capricorn (Makar) and Makar Rasshi (Capricorn Zodiac sign). I need more discussion with expert on this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cancer, Capricorn or any other Zodiac sign are related to the constellation seen in sky from the earth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cancer, Capricorn are two imaginary lines (that makes circle on the northen and southern hemisphere respectably)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Philosophy deals with intellect, logic, reasoning, analysis, and conclusion. It helps you in questioning everything including scientific knowledge, scriptures, traditions, culture, the ways of acquiring knowledge, the existence of God, the existence of your own, and try to understand abstract concepts like Akaasha, Time, the idea of Atman, different states of living like deep sleep, dream and awake. The origin of cosmos, and the origin of life. In fact philosophy deals with every subject in deep and not the obvious dimensions of any subject. That is why the highest degree for all streams of knowledge is called a Ph.D. (Doctorate in Philosophy). It explores the foundations, methods, history, implications, and purpose of science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Indian Constitution</title><link>https://localhost:1313/gk/The-Indian-Constitution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/gk/The-Indian-Constitution/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/gk/7004-The-Indian-Constitution.jpg" alt="The Indian Constitution">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An individual has different roles in personal, social, and professional life and s/he exists at the different levels. When one is interacting with others in the family or society or profession s/he is governed by ethics, culture, tradition, etc. All these help in forming rules. Some of these rules may be coming from your religious books and some others are unwritten rules of the family or society. When a state needs to manage its citizen or citizen need to interact with the state there are certain rules that guide interdependence and trust. In earlier times these rules were coming from our religious books or holy man. But over a period of time when states become a republic state where people of different faiths are living then one religious book cannot govern the rule of society and all the citizens. One book which governs all the citizens of a state and the state itself is called Constitution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Way of Learning</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/The-Way-of-Learning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/The-Way-of-Learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5208-The-Way-of-Learning.jpg" alt="The Way of Learning ">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you want to teach your children the process of making tea &lt;br>
then you don&amp;rsquo;t force them to memorize s for sugar, &lt;br>
g for ginger, t for tea, w for water, m for milk, b for boil, etc. &lt;br>
And if they don&amp;rsquo;t memorize you punish them? &lt;br>
You don&amp;rsquo;t offer them tea? &lt;br>
You don&amp;rsquo;t allow them to come into the kitchen till they remember the complete vocabulary? &lt;br>
If this is your way of teaching then it is horrible, &lt;br>
Children don&amp;rsquo;t need any jail or hell &lt;br>

&lt;p>The main body of classical Sanskrit literature consists of the sacred Hindu collections of poems and hymns known as the Vedas; the commentaries on the Vedas in the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas, and the Upanishads; epic poetry and wisdom literature; and poetry in a style called kavya. In the western sense, the term, usually spelled “classical,” is also used for the literature of any language in a period notable for the excellence and enduring quality of its writers&amp;rsquo; works. My education and upbringing have been in Indian Government schools and Indian villages, therefore, my practical exposure and a natural interest in Bhartiya Classical Literature is much more compared to Western, Arabic, and Chinese literature. During my study, I came across many ebooks and I thought to keep these with me in some shared drive for a quick reference. If you are looking for any of these books you can access them from the link mentioned below. It is a collection of approx 600 books (I keep adding and removing books in this eLibrary). It is approx 7 GB in size.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I don’t Know 2</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/i-dont-know-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/i-dont-know-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5204-I-Dont-Know-2.jpg" alt="I don’t Know 2">&lt;/p>

he feels helpless about his future. &lt;br>
In that situation dependency upon an unknown, unseen God is good. &lt;br>

No, it just represents that reality, and the absolute reality is very close to this. Whether it is a formula of gravity or force or angular momentum or energy calculations or anything else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Universal Culture</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-culture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5134-Universal-Culture.jpg" alt="Universal Culture">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, &lt;strong>there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial&lt;/strong>, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Human Compulsiveness</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/human-compulsiveness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/human-compulsiveness/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5126-Human-Compulsiveness.jpg" alt="Human Compulsiveness">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Compulsiveness is slavery. Generally people people confuse this with their freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s say one has a desire to eat or walk or talk or, watch TV, or for that matter do any so-called good or bad activity. If one can do that activity successfully as per one’s satisfaction then one thinks he exercised his freedom to ‘think’ and to ‘do’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Way Of Happiness</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-way-of-happiness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/the-way-of-happiness/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5119-The-Way-Of-Happiness.jpg" alt="The Way Of Happiness">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Sanskrit term Sukham has multiple &lt;br>
English translations like happiness, pleasure, joy, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sukham is the experience of an individual. &lt;br>
It is your own internal feeling. &lt;br>
It is not an objective reality outside, &lt;br>
like any physical thing. &lt;br>
The objective reality outside has an influence on this feeling &lt;br>
but for a wise person, it is in his own control that how he wants to feel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Relevance Of Guru</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/relevance-of-guru/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/relevance-of-guru/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5115-Relevance-Of-Guru.jpg" alt="Relevance Of Guru">&lt;/p>

Inspire the public to believe in god, called Bhakti. &lt;br>

Inspire the public to understand &lt;br>
the nature of God’s creation and God. &lt;br>

It forces you to believe &lt;br>
