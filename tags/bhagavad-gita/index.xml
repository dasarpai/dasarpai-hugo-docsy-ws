&lt;p>The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most highly respected books of the Hindus. It has been translated into almost every language in the world. It contains 700 shlokas. This text is part of the Mahabharata&amp;rsquo;s Bhishma Parva, which describes the first day of the battle when Bhishma was the commander-in-chief of the Kauravas. This separate book of 700 shlokas is a conversation between Arjuna and Bhagwan Krishna. It is in a question-and-answer format. Most of the questions were asked by Arjuna, but sometimes Krishna, in turn, asks questions in between and answers them. Here is the list of all the questions in the Bhagavad Gita. The chapter number and shloka number of each shloka are given. Based on your interest, you can look for the meaning and interpretation of these questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding the Meaning of Atma in the Bhagavad Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-atma-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-atma-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>!&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5281-meaning-of-atma.jpg" alt="Meaning of Atma">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Bhagavad Gita, the terms related to &amp;ldquo;soul&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; such as आत्मा (ātmā), मात्मनः (mātmanaḥ), मात्मा (mātmā), यात्मा (yātmā), and similar variations derived from the Sanskrit root ātman are used in various sense and meaning depends upon the context. Thinking Atma means always soul or Jiva is incorrect. The word ātman fundamentally refers to the &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; but its meaning shifts based on the philosophical and practical context within the text. Krishna, as the divine teacher, employs ātman to convey multiple layers of understanding—ranging from the physical body to the eternal, imperishable essence—reflecting the text&amp;rsquo;s deep metaphysical framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Essence of Bhagwat Gita: 2nd Chapter</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/essence-of-bhagwat-gita-2nd-chapter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/essence-of-bhagwat-gita-2nd-chapter/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5279-Essence-of-Bhagwat-Gita-2nd-Chapter.jpg" alt="The Essence of Bhagwat Gita: 2nd Chapter">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second chapter of Bhagavad Gita is &amp;ldquo;Sankhya Yoga&amp;rdquo; - The Yoga of Analysis. This chapter is one of the longest in the Bhagavad Gita, it has 72 slokas (verses). Sometimes people say if you understand this chapter throughly then you don&amp;rsquo;t need any other chapter, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
