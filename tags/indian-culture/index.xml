&lt;p>Whether you appreciate this or not, ancient Indian wisdom says the following. &lt;br>
If you are constantly losing intellectual debate, narrative then Brahminhood of your society is in danger. &lt;br>
If you are constantly losing physical fights with enemies then Kshatruyahood of the society is in danger. &lt;br>
If you are constantly losing trade to other countries or societies then Vaisyahood of the society is in danger. &lt;br>
If you are constantly producing substandard skills of your workforce to support your own three pillars and societies then your shoodrahood is in danger.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Indian Technological Advancement with Zero connection to Past</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/indian-technological-advancement-with-zero-connection-to-past/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/indian-technological-advancement-with-zero-connection-to-past/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5198-Indian-Technological-Advancement-With-Zero-Connection-To-Past.jpg" alt="Indian Technological Advancement with Zero connection to Past">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We complain in our society that a Bollywood hero gets quick fame, money, and reputation compared to a great scientist. We need to realize this is where we have brought our great culture of philosophy, debates, metallurgy, astrology, ayurveda, physics, mathematics and all other sciences. In the last 1000 years we couldn&amp;rsquo;t do much even whatever our ancestors have given to us. We worshiped and did pooja aarti of that, put that on our heads and in some puja rooms and temples. But never tried to understand and expand that body of knowledge.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Greeting and Culture</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/greeting-and-culture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/greeting-and-culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5190-Greeting-And-Culture.jpg" alt="Greeting and Culture">&lt;/p>

They ate the fruit of knowledge. &lt;br>
The Forbidden fruit. &lt;br>
Because of this knowledge, they became aware of their human nature &lt;br>
Following that, they knew their limitation, their emotion, and feeling &lt;br>
They became shy and covered their bodies. &lt;br>
This led to their sex life, &lt;br>
And because of sex, progeny happened. &lt;br>

&lt;p>All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, &lt;strong>there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial&lt;/strong>, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Equation Of Arjunas Arrows</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/equation-of-arjunas-arrows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/equation-of-arjunas-arrows/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5133-Equation-Of-Arjunas-Arrows.jpg" alt="Equation Of Arjunas Arrows">&lt;/p>
