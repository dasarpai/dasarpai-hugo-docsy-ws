&lt;p>PowerBI is a powerful tool for data analytics. This Business Intelligence tool is developed by Microsoft. This application was originally conceived by Thierry Dâ€™Hers and Amir Netz of the SQL Server Reporting Services Team at Microsoft. It was originally designed by Ron George in the summer of 2010 and named &lt;strong>Project Crescent&lt;/strong>. Project Crescent was initially available for public download on July 11, 2011, bundled with SQL Server Codename &lt;strong>Denali&lt;/strong>. Later renamed to &lt;strong>Power BI&lt;/strong> it was then unveiled by Microsoft in September 2013 as P&lt;strong>ower BI for Office 365&lt;/strong>. The first release of Power BI was based on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Microsoft Excel&lt;/a> based add-ins: Power Query, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pivot">Power Pivot&lt;/a> and Power View. With time, Microsoft also added many additional features like Question and Answers, enterprise-level data connectivity, and security options via Power BI Gateways. Power BI was first released to the public on July 24, 2015.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Balanced Score Card</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Understanding-Balanced-Score-Card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2017 11:14:08 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Understanding-Balanced-Score-Card/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1028-Balance-Scorecard-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In business intelligence (BI) there are two terms, Dimension, and Measures. Dimension is something which can be used for filtering, grouping purpose like department name, employee name, location, severity, priority, etc. The measure is something on which you can perform mathematical and statistical operations like average, sum, minimum, max, etc. Like salary, delay, time to solve a problem, number of tickets, travel expenses, fees, revenue, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enterprise Project Server 2016</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Enterprise-Project-Server-2016/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2016 13:42:13 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/pmblog/Enterprise-Project-Server-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/pmblog/1014-MicrosoftProject-Security.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
