&lt;li>You want to create a Flutter application but are unsure of which folders should be part of your project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You’ve recently joined a Flutter project team and are struggling to understand why there are so many folders and what they contain. If you create a file, you’re not sure where it should go.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your customer wants to add AI features to an existing Flutter project, and you don’t know where to place the ML models.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>If you want to add AI features to a Flutter app but don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing AI model, and your team or company is responsible for creating them, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to keep AI model development separate from the Flutter project. Once the model is ready, you can either embed it within the Flutter app or consume it via an API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Python Project Folders and Files</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Python-Project-Folders-and-Files/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Python-Project-Folders-and-Files/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6145-Python-Project-Folders-and-Files.jpg" alt="Python Project Folders and Files">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Python projects, certain folders and files serve specific purposes to help with organizing code, managing dependencies, setting up environments, and handling version control. These important directories and files are often seen in most well-structured Python projects. Here are some of the most common ones:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Folder Structure for ML Project</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Folder-Structure-for-ML-Project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:50:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Folder-Structure-for-ML-Project/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6010-Directory-Strucutre-of-ML-Project.jpg" alt="Configuration Management">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Directory Structure for ML Project&lt;/strong> is critical for any serious data science project. What we learn from a technology college and institution is useful in a real-world business, but the problem is that environment is completely different, and it takes proper guidance to adapt to a real business environment. Many times traveling on this path is full of frustration without any proper guidance. Sometimes guidance is there, but it is like blind is leading blind. One has already navigated a lot with struggle, so she/he is trying to guide a new person. Data-science education is not any different from this. From universities and institutions, we learn many concepts, algorithms, art, and science of developing models, etc. but when our customer or management tells us a problem with a simplistic dataset then we don’t know how to proceed. Although there are many templates and frameworks to approach, yet there is no simple cookie-cutter solution for all kinds of problems. Depending upon project duration, resources (human + machine + software), client, and his/her need, the technology available at hand we can choose different approaches.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
