&lt;p>Major players in the AI industry, such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc each have their own proprietary models and infrastructure to host these models. They offer AI services that companies use to develop AI products for either their end customers or internal use.

&lt;p>The discipline of Data Science and AI has introduced many terms into discussions that might seem complicated at first. In reality, many of these terms are intuitive and straightforward when considered from a natural intelligence perspective. However, from a technological standpoint, they can be complex. To understand XAI, letâ€™s explore a few examples.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
