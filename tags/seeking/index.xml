&lt;p>The main body of classical Sanskrit literature consists of the sacred Hindu collections of poems and hymns known as the Vedas; the commentaries on the Vedas in the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas, and the Upanishads; epic poetry and wisdom literature; and poetry in a style called kavya. In the western sense, the term, usually spelled “classical,” is also used for the literature of any language in a period notable for the excellence and enduring quality of its writers&amp;rsquo; works. My education and upbringing have been in Indian Government schools and Indian villages, therefore, my practical exposure and a natural interest in Bhartiya Classical Literature is much more compared to Western, Arabic, and Chinese literature. During my study, I came across many ebooks and I thought to keep these with me in some shared drive for a quick reference. If you are looking for any of these books you can access them from the link mentioned below. It is a collection of approx 600 books (I keep adding and removing books in this eLibrary). It is approx 7 GB in size.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I don’t Know 2</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/i-dont-know-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/i-dont-know-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5204-I-Dont-Know-2.jpg" alt="I don’t Know 2">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When a human is living in an uncertain or hostile environment &lt;br>
he feels helpless about his future. &lt;br>
In that situation dependency upon an unknown, unseen God is good. &lt;br>
Sometimes it is better to surrender rather than struggle.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
