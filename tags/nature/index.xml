&lt;p>If a man thinks he has done something against Mother Nature &lt;br>
that is why nature is punishing him or going to punish him then &lt;br>
he forgets that he himself is part of the parcel of nature. &lt;br>
There is no other separate nature away from your own bodily existence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Searching the Creator</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/searching-the-creator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/searching-the-creator/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5170-Searching-The-Creator.jpg" alt="Searching the Creator">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Without seeing or hearing about many things we know about their existence from the results of their functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see, this proves that I have eyes. &lt;br>
I am living, this proves that I have a heart. &lt;br>
I am thinking, this proves that I have a brain. &lt;br>
Food gets digested, proves I have an intestine. &lt;br>
I am breathing, this proves I have lungs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't Be Afraid Of Covid</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/dont-be-afraid-of-covid/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/dont-be-afraid-of-covid/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5122-Dont-Be-Afraid-Of-Covid.jpg" alt="Don’t Be Afraid Of Covid">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are a body of 15 trillion cells.&lt;br>
The human body is a colony of billions of viruses and bacterias.&lt;br>
Every day with food, water, and the air we consume those.&lt;br>
And they sustain our bodies.&lt;br>
That is why a newborn baby’s body becomes&lt;br>
5 feet or 6 feet in a span of 15 or 20 years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Universal Constants</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-constants/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/universal-constants/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5137-Universal-Constants.jpg" alt="Universal Constants">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are many other important constants in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. But these are the foundational constant of our known cosmos. If these values were different, then our existence could have not been possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
