&lt;p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized a wide range of industries, from customer support to content creation and beyond. As LLMs like GPT-4, T5, and BERT become integral to AI-driven applications, the need for specialized infrastructure to support their deployment, training, and scaling has grown significantly. Traditional cloud services, while effective for general-purpose computing, often fall short in addressing the unique challenges posed by these models, such as handling vast amounts of data, providing low-latency responses, and managing the immense computational load. As a result, businesses and developers are increasingly turning to platforms specifically optimized for LLMs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MLOps Tools</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/MLOps-Tools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/MLOps-Tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6137-MLOps-Tools.jpg" alt="MLOps-Tools">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and tools designed to streamline and automate the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models in production environments. It combines principles from both DevOps (Development Operations) and machine learning to ensure that ML models are deployed efficiently, managed effectively, and maintained reliably throughout their lifecycle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ML Model Development Framework</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ML-Model-Development-Framework/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ML-Model-Development-Framework/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6096-ML-Model-Development-Framework.jpg" alt="ML Model Development Framework">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are hundreds of &lt;a href="https://localhost:1313/dsblog/nlp-tasks">machine learning tasks&lt;/a>. To do these tasks there are &lt;a href="https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Type-of-Databases">thousands of datasets&lt;/a> created by individuals, governments, and corporations. We need to develop AI models using these datasets. There are thousands of models &lt;a href="dsblog/ML-Model-Repository-from-Pinto0309">1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://localhost:1313/dsblog/paperwithcode-resources">2&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://localhost:1313/dsblog/What-Are-Transformers-in-AI">3&lt;/a> and many model development frameworks. It is practically mind-blowing to track this whole body of work and understand all this work in its entirety. But if you dive deeper into the following frameworks you will get a fair idea about the overall direction of the work. These frameworks are used to maintain pre-trained model repositories and download pre-trained models. You can develop your own finetuned model using those pre-trained models.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Model Tuning with VertexAI</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Model-Tuning-with-VertexAI/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Model-Tuning-with-VertexAI/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6081-Model-Tuning-with-VertexAI.jpg" alt="Model Tuning with VertexAI">&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-genai">What is GenAI?&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#what-is-genai" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many kinds of AI models like classifier models, regressor models, clustering models, reinforcement models, etc. An AI model which has the ability to generate text, images, video, and music is called GenAI. They all take inspiration from the human brain, therefore they all have neural network (NN) architecture. There are dozens (if not hundreds) types of NN architecture that can be used to create different kinds of AI models. The type of NN architecture depends upon the data which is used for developing the model and the problem which we want to solve using AI model. Researchers in universities or big corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft keep developing new architecture, and using these architectures they develop the foundational models. Once foundational models are developed, they release a research paper. In this, they inform the world what architecture they used, what data they used, what parameters (weights &amp;amp; biases) the model has learned, what are the results of their product and compare that with other existing models. They can develop these foundational models with one set of hyperparameters, and they can release these foundational models of different sizes (it depends upon the number of parameters used). AI product builders pick up these foundational models and fine-tune these based on the exact business problem in their hands. Which foundational model do they choose, it also depends upon the size of the model, the kind of data it has used to create those foundational models, and what was the performance of the model on a similar task which the product developer want to solve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Demystifying DevOps, MLOps, and DataOps</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Demystifying-DevOps-MLOps-and-DataOps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Demystifying-DevOps-MLOps-and-DataOps/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6066-Demystifying-DevOps-MLOps-and-DataOps.jpg" alt="All Resources to Learn Data Science">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and efficiency between software development teams and IT operations teams. It emphasizes the integration of software development and IT operations, breaking down traditional silos and fostering a collaborative approach throughout the entire software delivery lifecycle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Folder Structure for ML Project</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Folder-Structure-for-ML-Project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:50:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Folder-Structure-for-ML-Project/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6010-Directory-Strucutre-of-ML-Project.jpg" alt="Configuration Management">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Directory Structure for ML Project&lt;/strong> is critical for any serious data science project. What we learn from a technology college and institution is useful in a real-world business, but the problem is that environment is completely different, and it takes proper guidance to adapt to a real business environment. Many times traveling on this path is full of frustration without any proper guidance. Sometimes guidance is there, but it is like blind is leading blind. One has already navigated a lot with struggle, so she/he is trying to guide a new person. Data-science education is not any different from this. From universities and institutions, we learn many concepts, algorithms, art, and science of developing models, etc. but when our customer or management tells us a problem with a simplistic dataset then we don’t know how to proceed. Although there are many templates and frameworks to approach, yet there is no simple cookie-cutter solution for all kinds of problems. Depending upon project duration, resources (human + machine + software), client, and his/her need, the technology available at hand we can choose different approaches.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
