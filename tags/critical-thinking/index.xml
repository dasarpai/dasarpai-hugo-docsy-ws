&lt;p>Question-Answering task is one of the tasks in NLP-Task. To create a high-performing AI system that can understand the question correctly and answer appropriately, we need to train a model. And to train a model, we need to have a good-quality dataset in place. Without understanding what are the different formats of questions and answers, we cannot create a dataset. In our day-to-day life we never pay attention to this minute detail but to create an AI system that can perform QA tasks, we need to understand the different formats of questions. In this article, I am creating a list of these different types of questions. To create an AI system that can perform all these kinds of QA tasks, we need to craft the dataset very carefully. Although, we see lots of data around, but to create an NLP-Task specific dataset is tedious task.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cognitive Biases</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/cognitive-biases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/cognitive-biases/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/dspost/dsp6051-Cognitive-Biases.jpg" alt="Cognitive Bias">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cognitive biases are the systematic errors that occur when individuals deviate from rational decision-making. These biases are a result of our brain&amp;rsquo;s ability to process information, which can sometimes lead to irrational thinking and decision-making. As data science continues to advance, it is critical to understand how cognitive biases can impact AI, ML, NLP, deep learning, and robotics. Cognitive biases can lead to biased data collection, modeling, and decision-making processes, which can ultimately impact the accuracy and effectiveness of these technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Science of Reasoning</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/The-Science-of-Reasoning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 15:50:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/The-Science-of-Reasoning/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-science-of-reasoning">The Science of Reasoning&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#the-science-of-reasoning" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Reasoning is a unique ability in humans. Whatever civilizational advancement we see, it is because of our ability to think, imagine and reason. We all give reasons and ask for reasons but most humans don&amp;rsquo;t understand the fallacies of reasoning. Due to this sometimes we are putting forward a correct point but we are using the wrong reasoning.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
