&lt;p>When we say nowadays the surrounding is corrupt,&lt;br>
we need to ask: where does this surrounding start?&lt;br>
At my heart, skin, bedroom, flat, apartment, district, state, etc.?&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves how we reached the conclusion&lt;br>
that it was not corrupt earlier.&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves what we are doing,&lt;br>
apart from adding to that corruption at our own level.&lt;br>
If I am not part of the solution,&lt;br>
then there is a high chance I am part of the problem.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
