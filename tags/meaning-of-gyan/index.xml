&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;यज्ञ&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Yagnya or Yajnya), which closely translates to &amp;ldquo;sacrifice&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a Western sense, it refers to sacrificing or offering something very dear to you to a higher power, God, or a higher cause. In Vedanta, though, it carries multiple meanings, and without understanding Vedic culture and context, one cannot fully grasp this word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Word Knowledge or Gyan or Jnyana in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5286-meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;ज्ञान&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Gyan or Jnyana), which translates to &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a worldly sense, when we talk about knowledge, we usually refer to information about something—generally objects, people, processes, or events around us. Sometimes, it also refers to our own body; for a slightly deeper thinker, it includes the mind and ego as well. But for a spiritual seeker, this &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is not an external thing or &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; at all but the Self.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
