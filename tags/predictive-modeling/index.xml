&lt;p>In this article I am going to discuss the basics of astrology and the data science aspect of astrology. I am defending here a big case of model retraining and without retraining if we are doing prediction from the old model that won&amp;rsquo;t be effective. Although in today&amp;rsquo;s time of data privacy, secrecy, getting personal data to create a prediction model is very costly or impossible for any corporation. As of today whatever data corporations are using to create the model of health care or public good or promoting a product for that anonymized data can be used but to create astrology models we need actual data. Only the government can get this data but the public doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust the government to create this model for predicting their life. What will be the future of Astrology and Jyotish in the coming time depends upon many factors, one of which is trust between governments and the public. The government can creates astrology models for the well being of the society. Without this, whatever astrology or Jyotish we are doing today it is becoming less trustworthy everyday.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Linear Regression Interview Questions</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/Linear-Regression-Interview-Questions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 15:50:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/dsblog/Linear-Regression-Interview-Questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/dspost/dsp6022-Linear-Regression-Interview-Questions.jpg" alt="Prompt Engineering for GPT4">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this question-answer article, I will try that the start of every answer from example rather than theory (some unavoidable variation may be possible). I firmly believe if examples are clear, human mind is smart enough in generlization and creating theories.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
