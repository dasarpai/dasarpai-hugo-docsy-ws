&lt;p>When a human kills, &lt;br>
cooks and eats helpless creature &lt;br>
and no God, Allah, Devi, Devta, Jesus &lt;br>
come to help that helpless creature &lt;br>
then how come this intelligent human being &lt;br>
think that when s/he is being exploited, &lt;br>
cheated, molested, robbed, deceived, &lt;br>
grilled and cooked by other people &lt;br>
or nature or religion, culture, government around &lt;br>
then god will come to protect him?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
