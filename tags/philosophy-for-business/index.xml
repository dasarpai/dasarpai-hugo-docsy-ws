&lt;p>The Sanskrit term Sukham has multiple &lt;br>
English translations like happiness, pleasure, joy, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sukham is the experience of an individual. &lt;br>
It is your own internal feeling. &lt;br>
It is not an objective reality outside, &lt;br>
like any physical thing. &lt;br>
The objective reality outside has an influence on this feeling &lt;br>
but for a wise person, it is in his own control that how he wants to feel.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saving The Moon</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/saving-the-moon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/saving-the-moon/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5113-Saving-The-Moon.jpg" alt="Saving The Moon">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You know my friend Pratibimba, &lt;br>
He is a big man, but sometimes &lt;br>
he behaves like a child and too naive about the reality around. &lt;br>
Once upon a time, &lt;br>
It was the day of the festival and late evening &lt;br>
and he was traveling through a forest &lt;br>
Long he traveled and feeling thirsty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leadership In Troubled Time</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/leadership-in-troubled-time/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/leadership-in-troubled-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5061-Leadership-In-Troubled-Time.jpg" alt="Leadership In Troubled Time">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Enough we read, hear and lecture &lt;br>
Especially in the management profession and leadership positions. &lt;br>
Life every moment unfolds surprises &lt;br>
Many bring joy and others brings failure and sadness together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is CSR</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-csr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-csr/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5056-What-Is-Csr.jpg" alt="What Is CSR">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept &lt;br>
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society. &lt;br>
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit &lt;br>
among the employees, investors &amp;amp; other stakeholders. &lt;br>
But should consider society around &lt;br>
as an integral part of their existence to survive. &lt;br>
But why should any corporate do this CSR program? &lt;br>
Because they are large fish in the pond &lt;br>
therefore they should show compassion to the others &lt;br>
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together &lt;br>
otherwise, they themselves will in danger? &lt;br>
Because society has given the platform to perform &lt;br>
therefore they should reciprocate? &lt;br>
Because they should comply with government regulations? &lt;br>
Because they will get more name and fame &lt;br>
as a compassionate organization &lt;br>
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further &lt;br>
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future? &lt;br>
Any sensible person need to understand &lt;br>
no one can exist longer in isolation, &lt;br>
so it is about the entire ecosystem. &lt;br>
In an ecosystem every individual &lt;br>
no matter how small they are &lt;br>
they play some significant role. &lt;br>
If you try to manipulate the system &lt;br>
and alter some element of the ecosystem &lt;br>
then there are consequences of it. &lt;br>
By doing so either you change &lt;br>
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair &lt;br>
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Which Metrics Does Really Matter?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/which-metrics-does-really-matter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/which-metrics-does-really-matter/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5036-Which-Metrics-Does-Really-Matter.jpg" alt="Which Metrics Does Really Matter?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Whether our general knowledge &lt;br>

What we want to know or value looks something like this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
