&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Story Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;: A visual practice for organizing work into a useful model to help understand the sets of high-value features to be created over time, identify omissions in the backlog, and effectively plan releases that deliver value to users.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variance at Completion (VAC)&lt;/strong&gt;: A projection of the amount of budget deficit or surplus, expressed as the difference between the budget at completion and the estimate at completion. See also budget at completion (BAC), cost variance (CV), estimate at completion (EAC), and variance analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variation&lt;/strong&gt;: An actual condition that is different from the expected condition that is contained in the baseline plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification&lt;/strong&gt;: The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or result complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. Contrast with validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verified Deliverables&lt;/strong&gt;: Completed project deliverables that have been checked and confirmed for correctness through the Control Quality process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Teams&lt;/strong&gt;: Groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with little or no time spent meeting face to face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice of the Customer&lt;/strong&gt;: A planning technique used to provide products, services, and results that truly reflect customer requirements by translating those customer requirements into the appropriate technical requirements for each phase of project product development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WBS Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;: A document that provides detailed deliverable, activity, and scheduling information about each component in the work breakdown structure. See also work breakdown structure (WBS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weighted Milestone Method&lt;/strong&gt;: A method of estimating earned value in which the budget value of a work package is divided into measurable segments, each ending with a milestone that is assigned a weighted budget value. See also fixed formula method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What-If Scenario Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: The process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their effect on project objectives.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Package&lt;/strong&gt;: The work defined at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure for which cost and duration are estimated and managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Performance Data&lt;/strong&gt;: The raw observations and measurements identified during activities being performed to carry out the project work.&lt;/li&gt;
