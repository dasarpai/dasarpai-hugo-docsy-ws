&lt;p>There are three ways of living a conscious life, wakeful life. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.

but even our own people don&amp;rsquo;t understand these fully.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Appreciate the Architecture of Mind</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/appreciate-the-architecture-of-mind/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/appreciate-the-architecture-of-mind/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5174-Appreciate-The-Architecture-Of-Mind.jpg" alt="Appreciate the Architecture of Mind">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We blame the mind like a monkey, it keeps dancing and makes the body and the world around dance and create problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awareness and Consciousness</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/awareness-and-consciousness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/awareness-and-consciousness/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5171-Awareness-And-Consciousness.jpg" alt="Awareness and Consciousness">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Awareness comes from consciousness; they both are not the same. Consciousness is everywhere in the entire universe but awareness belongs to life. Plants, insects, animals, and humans have awareness. When you are sleeping you are conscious but not aware. Body parts which make life, like tissues, cells and protein have awareness. Do molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons have awareness? Does the earth, moon, sun and other stars have awareness? Ancient eastern wisdom says the cosmos is not dead therefore even the sky has awareness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mirror, Image and Face</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/mirror-image-and-face/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/mirror-image-and-face/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5169-Mirror-Image-And-Face.jpg" alt="Mirror, Image and Face">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You go before a mirror for various reasons. When you have doubt, when there is a curiosity, when someone compliments or points something out or just for the time-pass.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Challenges In The Meditation Process</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/challenges-in-the-meditation-process/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/challenges-in-the-meditation-process/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5150-Challenges-In-The-Meditation-Process.jpg" alt="Challenges In The Meditation Process">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can meditate with open eyes &lt;br>
and you can meditate with closed eyes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you want to meditate with open eyes &lt;br>
then the objective is to handle the worldly affair properly. &lt;br>
Doing work with Dhyana. &lt;br>
Knowing the world properly and working properly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
