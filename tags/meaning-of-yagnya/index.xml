&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;यज्ञ&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Yagnya or Yajnya), which closely translates to &amp;ldquo;sacrifice&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a Western sense, it refers to sacrificing or offering something very dear to you to a higher power, God, or a higher cause. In Vedanta, though, it carries multiple meanings, and without understanding Vedic culture and context, one cannot fully grasp this word.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
