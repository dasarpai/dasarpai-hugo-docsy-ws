&lt;p>When you are convinced of something then to convey that experience you use words. Because you do not have credibility to be believed so you refer from the best seller books, holy books, from your guru&amp;rsquo;s books etc. After this you think, your experience is transmitted to others. &lt;br>
Fortunately the human mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way and the message is still not gone. See around how many holy books, Guru-Vaakya, best selling books, are existing. How many people “truly” believe in those books?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
