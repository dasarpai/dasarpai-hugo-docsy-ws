&lt;p>When you are convinced of something then to convey that experience you use words. Because you do not have credibility to be believed so you refer from the best seller books, holy books, from your guru&amp;rsquo;s books etc. After this you think, your experience is transmitted to others. &lt;br>
Fortunately the human mind doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way and the message is still not gone. See around how many holy books, Guru-Vaakya, best selling books, are existing. How many people “truly” believe in those books?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>World Around</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/world-around/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/world-around/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5145-World-Around.jpg" alt="World Around">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All humans have the same body structure eyes, ears, hands, feet, etc., except very few gender level differences. We make this little difference of the body so much that it becomes a gender issue. It looks like a huge issue as if men and women are coming from different planets, or they are made of different materials. On this little difference, we have issues of feminism, patriarchy, etc. But leaving that little difference aside, &lt;strong>there are many differences at the non-physical level which are non-trivial&lt;/strong>, and they are much more important differences than the physical difference of males and females.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Balance Food Diet?</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-balance-food-diet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-balance-food-diet/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5131-What-Is-Balance-Food-Diet.jpg" alt="What Is Balance Food Diet?">&lt;/p>

Protein is made of molecules. &lt;br>
A molecule is made of atoms. &lt;br>

&lt;p>As per the law of physics all the planets, stars and galaxies &lt;br>
want to go in a straight line &lt;br>
but it is a gravitational force due to which they start rotating. &lt;br>
But they are not aware that they are rotating. Are they? &lt;br>
For humans also the same thing applies. &lt;br>
But, human knows, he is in a circle &lt;br>
and it is not possible to break the circle. &lt;br>
Therefore instead of looking at purpose in a straight line &lt;br>
he looks at the purpose in a circular motion. &lt;br>
This circular motion is created &lt;br>
by another kind of gravitational force in life, &lt;br>
you can call it love, greed, attachment, attraction, desire, etc. &lt;br>
Ancient scripture throws upon us an idea of Liberation, Moksha. &lt;br>
It means freedom from the eternal endless circle. &lt;br>
But, what does that mean? &lt;br>
Going infinitely in a straight line like planets can go without gravity? &lt;br>
Or not going anywhere? &lt;br>
Or be everywhere? &lt;br>
Or completely destroy and be one with the cosmos? &lt;br>
Ignorantly many people think that is another kind of joy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Concept Of Yoga</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5067-The-Concept-Of-Yoga.jpg" alt="The Concept Of Yoga">&lt;/p>
