&lt;p>Major players in the AI industry, such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc each have their own proprietary models and infrastructure to host these models. They offer AI services that companies use to develop AI products for either their end customers or internal use.

However, the deployment and inference stages are even more expensive, as they involve ongoing costs for hardware and monitoring.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
