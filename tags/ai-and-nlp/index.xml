&lt;p>The landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally been dominated by cloud-based services. While powerful, these often come with costs, privacy concerns, and require constant internet connectivity. Ollama emerges as a compelling open-source solution, designed to simplify the process of downloading, managing, and running LLMs directly on your local machine. This approach offers significant advantages, including enhanced privacy, cost savings, offline capability, and greater control over the models you use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ps-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Conflicting-Evidence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ps-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Conflicting-Evidence/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6261-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-with-Conflicting-Evidence.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The hypothesis of this paper is that &lt;strong>real-world retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems must simultaneously handle various sources of conflicting information, including ambiguity in user queries and contradictory information arising from misinformation and noise in retrieved documents&lt;/strong>. The authors argue that prior work has largely addressed these challenges in isolation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LLM Internal Encoding of Truthfulness and Hallucinations</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ps-LLM-Internal-Encoding-of-Truthfulness-and-Hallucinations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ps-LLM-Internal-Encoding-of-Truthfulness-and-Hallucinations/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6260-LLM-Internal-Encoding-of-Truthfulness-and-Hallucinations.jpg" alt="LLM Internal Encoding of Truthfulness and Hallucinations">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objective of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of errors produced by large language models (LLMs) by examining their internal representations. The authors aim to reveal how information about the truthfulness of LLM outputs is encoded internally, going beyond extrinsic, behavioral analysis. They also seek to investigate the relationship between these internal representations and the external behavior of LLMs, including their tendency to produce inaccuracies or &amp;ldquo;hallucinations&amp;rdquo;. Furthermore, the paper intends to explore whether internal representations can be used to predict the types of errors LLMs make and to detect the correct answer even when the model generates an incorrect one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI News - February 2025</title><link>https://localhost:1313/news/AI-News-Feb-2025/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/news/AI-News-Feb-2025/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/news/8005-AI-News-Feb-2025.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
