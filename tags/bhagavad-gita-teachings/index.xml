&lt;p>From our experience we say&lt;br>
Doing transaction of any kind &lt;br>
Whether social, commercial, religious &lt;br>
We need another &lt;br>
But if we don&amp;rsquo;t know about another &lt;br>
Then transaction can be risky &lt;br>
It can cause pain, hurt, loss or suffering &lt;br>
Therefore don&amp;rsquo;t transact with unknown. &lt;br>

&lt;p>Out of habit, we ask when someone dies,&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;Oh, how did he die?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
He was young,&lt;br>
He was good, religious,&lt;br>
He practiced yoga, cared for his health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Ahamkar in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-ahamkar-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-ahamkar-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5292-meaning-of-ahamkar-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Ahamkar in Bhagwat Gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In my view, the distinction between &lt;strong>Ahamkaara&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Ego&lt;/strong> is subtle yet profound, especially when viewed from a philosophical and spiritual lens. Ahamkara is &lt;strong>a tool that can be refined&lt;/strong>, whereas ego is &lt;strong>an illusion that must be dissolved&lt;/strong>. If Ahamkara leads to the realization that &lt;strong>all is one&lt;/strong>, it becomes a stepping stone to enlightenment. But if it binds one to the material world, it becomes just another name for ego.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Prakriti in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5293-meaning-of-prakriti-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Prakriti in Bhagwat Gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Sanskrit word Prakriti or Prakruti has multiple meanings and is used in the Bhagavad Gita in different contexts. In the English language, we try to translate it to &amp;ldquo;Nature&amp;rdquo;. But, does this word really summarize the meaning of the Sanskrit word? To better understand, you need to look at these 25 slokas. You may not get a complete answer, but it will help you delve deeper and transcend existence.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Yagnya in Bhagwat gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-yagnya-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-yagnya-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5287-meaning-of-yagnya-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;यज्ञ&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Yagnya or Yajnya), which closely translates to &amp;ldquo;sacrifice&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a Western sense, it refers to sacrificing or offering something very dear to you to a higher power, God, or a higher cause. In Vedanta, though, it carries multiple meanings, and without understanding Vedic culture and context, one cannot fully grasp this word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Word Knowledge or Gyan or Jnyana in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5286-meaning-of-knowledge-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;ज्ञान&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Gyan or Jnyana), which translates to &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a worldly sense, when we talk about knowledge, we usually refer to information about something—generally objects, people, processes, or events around us. Sometimes, it also refers to our own body; for a slightly deeper thinker, it includes the mind and ego as well. But for a spiritual seeker, this &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is not an external thing or &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; at all but the Self.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bhagwat Gita Oneliner Lessons Chapterwise</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5285-bhagwat-gita-oneliner-lessons-chapterwise.jpg" alt="Bhagwat Gita Oneliner Lessons Chapterwise">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu scripture, consists of 18 chapters, each addressing different aspects of life, duty, and spirituality through the dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to daily read, connect, assimilate, and practice the teachings, then these 18 lines can help you to start with. There is no shortcut in life; don&amp;rsquo;t assume this is all. This is just a starter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-yoga-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-yoga-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5284-meaning-of-yoga-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Yoga in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most highly respected books of the Hindus. It has been translated into almost every language in the world. It contains 700 shlokas. This text is part of the Mahabharata&amp;rsquo;s Bhishma Parva, which describes the first day of the battle when Bhishma was the commander-in-chief of the Kauravas. This separate book of 700 shlokas is a conversation between Arjuna and Bhagwan Krishna. It is in a question-and-answer format. Most of the questions were asked by Arjuna, but sometimes Krishna, in turn, asks questions in between and answers them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Meaning of Word Dharma in Bhagwat Gita</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-dharma-in-bhagavad-gita/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-dharma-in-bhagavad-gita/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5283-meaning-of-dharma-in-bhagavad-gita.jpg" alt="The Meaning of Word Dharma in Bhagwat gita">&lt;/p>
