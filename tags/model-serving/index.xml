&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Amazon
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Amazon has many products and one of their product is &lt;strong>AWS Cloud&lt;/strong>. Under this product they sell IT infrastructure (storage, memory, network, VM, webhosting etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Amazon SageMaker&lt;/strong> is Cloud based Machine Learning Platform, and this is one of the product under AWS Cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amazon SageMaker can be used to train AI model, host AI model, monitor the model and hosts many other services which any Data Science project need from data gathering to model serving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AWS is oldest cloud service provider in the market.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AWS Sagemaker was launched in Nov'17.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Google has hundreds of products like gmail, youtube, google drive etc. One of their product is called &lt;strong>Google Cloud&lt;/strong>. Under this product they sell IT infrastrcture like Amazon sells under AWS.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>VertexAI&lt;/strong> is Cloud based Machine Learning platform of Google. VertexAI is part of Google Cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>VertexAI can be used to train AI Model,host AI model, monitor the model etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>VertexAI was launched in Jun'21&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Like Amazon&amp;rsquo;s cloud platform which is called AWS Cloud, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s cloud plateform is called &lt;strong>Azure&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s AI product is called &lt;strong>Azure Machine Learning&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Today (Jul'23) Azure Machine Learning has has most of the capabilites than any other player&amp;rsquo;s AI product.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Azure Machine Learning was launched Feb'14&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-genai">What is GenAI?&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#what-is-genai" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many kinds of AI models like classifier models, regressor models, clustering models, reinforcement models, etc. An AI model which has the ability to generate text, images, video, and music is called GenAI. They all take inspiration from the human brain, therefore they all have neural network (NN) architecture. There are dozens (if not hundreds) types of NN architecture that can be used to create different kinds of AI models. The type of NN architecture depends upon the data which is used for developing the model and the problem which we want to solve using AI model. Researchers in universities or big corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft keep developing new architecture, and using these architectures they develop the foundational models. Once foundational models are developed, they release a research paper. In this, they inform the world what architecture they used, what data they used, what parameters (weights &amp;amp; biases) the model has learned, what are the results of their product and compare that with other existing models. They can develop these foundational models with one set of hyperparameters, and they can release these foundational models of different sizes (it depends upon the number of parameters used). AI product builders pick up these foundational models and fine-tune these based on the exact business problem in their hands. Which foundational model do they choose, it also depends upon the size of the model, the kind of data it has used to create those foundational models, and what was the performance of the model on a similar task which the product developer want to solve.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
