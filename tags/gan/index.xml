&lt;p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for unsupervised learning. It was developed and introduced by Ian J. Goodfellow in 2014. It is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. GANs are used for generative tasks, such as creating realistic images, videos, or even audio.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
