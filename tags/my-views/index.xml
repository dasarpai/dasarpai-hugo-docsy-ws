&lt;p>When we say nowadays the surrounding is corrupt,&lt;br>
we need to ask: where does this surrounding start?&lt;br>
At my heart, skin, bedroom, flat, apartment, district, state, etc.?&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves how we reached the conclusion&lt;br>
that it was not corrupt earlier.&lt;br>
We need to ask ourselves what we are doing,&lt;br>
apart from adding to that corruption at our own level.&lt;br>
If I am not part of the solution,&lt;br>
then there is a high chance I am part of the problem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Vijayadashami 2024</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/Happy-Vijayadashami-2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/Happy-Vijayadashami-2024/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5271-Happy-Vijaydashmi-2024.jpg" alt="Happy Vijayadashami 2024">&lt;/p>

It may be health, money, relationships, etc.&lt;br>
Everyone has these kinds of resources.&lt;br>
Some have less, some more, and others may be extremely rich.&lt;br>

&lt;p>Let’s say one has a desire to eat or walk or talk or, watch TV, or for that matter do any so-called good or bad activity.

&lt;p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept &lt;br>
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society. &lt;br>
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit &lt;br>
among the employees, investors &amp;amp; other stakeholders. &lt;br>
But should consider society around &lt;br>
as an integral part of their existence to survive. &lt;br>
But why should any corporate do this CSR program? &lt;br>
Because they are large fish in the pond &lt;br>
therefore they should show compassion to the others &lt;br>
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together &lt;br>
otherwise, they themselves will in danger? &lt;br>
Because society has given the platform to perform &lt;br>
therefore they should reciprocate? &lt;br>
Because they should comply with government regulations? &lt;br>
Because they will get more name and fame &lt;br>
as a compassionate organization &lt;br>
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further &lt;br>
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future? &lt;br>
Any sensible person need to understand &lt;br>
no one can exist longer in isolation, &lt;br>
so it is about the entire ecosystem. &lt;br>
In an ecosystem every individual &lt;br>
no matter how small they are &lt;br>
they play some significant role. &lt;br>
If you try to manipulate the system &lt;br>
and alter some element of the ecosystem &lt;br>
then there are consequences of it. &lt;br>
By doing so either you change &lt;br>
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair &lt;br>
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meaning Of Secular</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-secular/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/meaning-of-secular/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5052-Meaning-Of-Secular.jpg" alt="Meaning Of Secular">&lt;/p>
