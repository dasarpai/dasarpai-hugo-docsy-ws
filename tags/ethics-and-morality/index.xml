something horrible related to him &lt;br>
happens around him and he is unaware. &lt;br>

after 8 hours or after 24 days. &lt;br>

&lt;p>People Question Rama, why he left Sita because someone questioned Sita&amp;rsquo;s character? Rama should have defended and continued as king.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you remember once Uma took the form of Sita to test the divinity of Rama. But, just because Shiva had seen Sita in Uma for a short time, he denounced Uma as wife and said you are my Mother now because Rama is my Aradhya. Such are the ideals in Hinduism. Post this event she went to her father&amp;rsquo;s house and in some incident jumped into fire. Shiva became disturbed and he destroyed Yagnya of Daksha. He carried Uma on her shoulders for many years and finally Vishnu cut the dead body into pieces. Post this Shiva goes to long Meditation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Labeling Good and Bad</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/labeling-good-and-bad/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/labeling-good-and-bad/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5163-Labeling-Good-And-Bad.jpg" alt="Labeling Good and Bad">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Compulsiveness is slavery. Generally people people confuse this with their freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s say one has a desire to eat or walk or talk or, watch TV, or for that matter do any so-called good or bad activity. If one can do that activity successfully as per one’s satisfaction then one thinks he exercised his freedom to ‘think’ and to ‘do’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Morality Of Killing</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/morality-of-killing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/morality-of-killing/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5099-Morality-Of-Killing.jpg" alt="Morality Of Killing">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Killing is sin and it is immoral. &lt;br>
What I want to kill is not existing because of my action &lt;br>
But because of my inaction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Peace Or The Peace</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/about-peace-or-the-peace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/about-peace-or-the-peace/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5020-About-Peace-Or-The-Peace.jpg" alt="About Peace Or The Peace">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Peace and happiness in life is a desire of every human. &lt;br>
Is it a goal of life, which we shall achieve one day? &lt;br>
If you don’t have it then it may be a goal for you. &lt;br>
Otherwise it a basic requirement of a human. &lt;br>
We want to talk peacefully, eat peacefully, &lt;br>
walk peacefully, sleep peacefully, and whatnot.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
