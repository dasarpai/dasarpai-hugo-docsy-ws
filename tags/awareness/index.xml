&lt;p>A person is in comma or deep sleep and &lt;br>
something horrible related to him &lt;br>
happens around him and he is unaware. &lt;br>
He comes to know about this when he &lt;br>
come out of coma or deep sleep. &lt;br>
His deep sleep or comma may break &lt;br>
after 8 hours or after 24 days. &lt;br>
What happened to him during his sleep was because of his Paapam or Punyam?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Awareness and Consciousness</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/awareness-and-consciousness/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/awareness-and-consciousness/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5171-Awareness-And-Consciousness.jpg" alt="Awareness and Consciousness">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Awareness comes from consciousness; they both are not the same. Consciousness is everywhere in the entire universe but awareness belongs to life. Plants, insects, animals, and humans have awareness. When you are sleeping you are conscious but not aware. Body parts which make life, like tissues, cells and protein have awareness. Do molecules, atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons have awareness? Does the earth, moon, sun and other stars have awareness? Ancient eastern wisdom says the cosmos is not dead therefore even the sky has awareness.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
