&lt;p>The objective of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding of errors produced by large language models (LLMs) by examining their internal representations. The authors aim to reveal how information about the truthfulness of LLM outputs is encoded internally, going beyond extrinsic, behavioral analysis. They also seek to investigate the relationship between these internal representations and the external behavior of LLMs, including their tendency to produce inaccuracies or &amp;ldquo;hallucinations&amp;rdquo;. Furthermore, the paper intends to explore whether internal representations can be used to predict the types of errors LLMs make and to detect the correct answer even when the model generates an incorrect one.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
