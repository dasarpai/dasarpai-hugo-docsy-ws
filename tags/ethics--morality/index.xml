&lt;p>In Christianity, what is the biggest sin of Adam and Eve? &lt;br>
They ate the fruit of knowledge. &lt;br>
The Forbidden fruit. &lt;br>
Because of this knowledge, they became aware of their human nature &lt;br>
Following that, they knew their limitation, their emotion, and feeling &lt;br>
They became shy and covered their bodies. &lt;br>
This led to their sex life, &lt;br>
And because of sex, progeny happened. &lt;br>
And we humans are the creation of that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Violence</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-violence/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-violence/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5062-What-Is-Violence.jpg" alt="What Is Violence">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In nature every entity has life. &lt;br>
Life means takes birth, grows, decay, and die. &lt;br>
Look around and identify &lt;br>
what is that which is permanently there? &lt;br>
A lifetime of life may vary &lt;br>
from microseconds to billions of years. &lt;br>
But everything comes into existence and disappears.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is CSR</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-csr/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/what-is-csr/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5056-What-Is-Csr.jpg" alt="What Is CSR">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a concept &lt;br>
Where a corporate should own the responsibility of society. &lt;br>
They should not simply make a profit, share the profit &lt;br>
among the employees, investors &amp;amp; other stakeholders. &lt;br>
But should consider society around &lt;br>
as an integral part of their existence to survive. &lt;br>
But why should any corporate do this CSR program? &lt;br>
Because they are large fish in the pond &lt;br>
therefore they should show compassion to the others &lt;br>
and hence do not eat all the fishes of pond together &lt;br>
otherwise, they themselves will in danger? &lt;br>
Because society has given the platform to perform &lt;br>
therefore they should reciprocate? &lt;br>
Because they should comply with government regulations? &lt;br>
Because they will get more name and fame &lt;br>
as a compassionate organization &lt;br>
and they can capitalize on that power to grow further &lt;br>
and cover up their wrongs of past, present, and future? &lt;br>
Any sensible person need to understand &lt;br>
no one can exist longer in isolation, &lt;br>
so it is about the entire ecosystem. &lt;br>
In an ecosystem every individual &lt;br>
no matter how small they are &lt;br>
they play some significant role. &lt;br>
If you try to manipulate the system &lt;br>
and alter some element of the ecosystem &lt;br>
then there are consequences of it. &lt;br>
By doing so either you change &lt;br>
the rules of the game unilaterally, which is unfair &lt;br>
or the entire system comes to danger because of your actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Religion Of Humanity</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/religion-of-humanity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/religion-of-humanity/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5051-Religion-Of-Humanity.jpg" alt="Religion Of Humanity">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We know for sure that birds, insects, reptiles &amp;amp; animals &lt;br>
are the citizen of this planet. &lt;br>
But, we do not know for sure that &lt;br>
Human on this earth &lt;br>
Came from another planet &lt;br>
Or the evolution of animal on this planet &lt;br>
Or God created humanity in his mind &lt;br>
Every religion has its own cosmology. &lt;br>
Biologists and theoretical physicists still debating the point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Driven By Humanity Or Morality</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/driven-by-humanity-or-morality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/driven-by-humanity-or-morality/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5050-Driven-By-Humanity-Or-Morality.jpg" alt="Driven By Humanity Or Morality">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fear, pain, reward, and punishment, &lt;br>
either from government or authorities or God or Karma &lt;br>
Is always the driving force for a human to be righteous.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
