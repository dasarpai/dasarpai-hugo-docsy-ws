&lt;p>When you see sun is rising and settings &lt;br>
But you know it doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Approx 72 inch is human body height &lt;br>
One inch in eye size &lt;br>
One tenth is size of pupil in the eye &lt;br>
A small dust particle is enough to stop us seeing the world around &lt;br>
But we can big objects around and compare &lt;br>
From eyes we know a cow is bigger than a goat &lt;br>
Goat is bigger than cat &lt;br>
Cat is bigger than mouse &lt;br>
Mouse is bigger than ant &lt;br>
Ant is bigger than sugar particle &lt;br>
None of these objects or their sizes &lt;br>
exists in our mind &lt;br>
Still we can compare &lt;br>
Retina of eye convert light signals to electric signals &lt;br>
Brain processes electric signals &lt;br>
Processing of these signals is chemical process &lt;br>
Process is same for all human being &lt;br>
But even after that &lt;br>
we all understand the world in different way &lt;br>
It is Maya.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
