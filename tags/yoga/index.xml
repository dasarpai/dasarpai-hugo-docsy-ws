&lt;p>Inhaling is different from exhaling and &lt;br>
Exhaling is different from inhaling &lt;br>
Both never happens to us at the same time &lt;br>
But both happen continuously, one after another.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Food And Nourishment</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/about-food-and-nourishment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/about-food-and-nourishment/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5143-About-Food-And-Nourishment.jpg" alt="About Food And Nourishment">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We have three living bodies embedded together &lt;br>
But superficially it looks one. &lt;br>
When it comes to nourishing, it is our responsibility to nourish all three. &lt;br>
Consuming food that nourishes the &lt;br>
Only one body and ignoring others is not wise. &lt;br>
If you do it willingly, then it is a type of slow suicide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Source Of Energy</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/managing-source-of-energy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/managing-source-of-energy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5076-Managing-Source-Of-Energy.jpg" alt="Managing Source Of Energy">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If we group people based on &lt;br>
their energy characteristics &lt;br>
then groups will look like this.Volcano, Pressure cooker on burning heat stove, &lt;br>
explosive bomb, LED bulb, Small led light, &lt;br>
Halogen bulb in the street, Hot black color plate &lt;br>
which cannot be seen as hot, &lt;br>
hot coffee, a cube of ice, and a mountain of snow.Every energy body around us has &lt;br>
their relevance and purpose, &lt;br>
Living in happiness with that energy source &lt;br>
depends upon who is handling and &lt;br>
how that energy source is handled.In business, social, or family life &lt;br>
we suffer because we don’t know &lt;br>
how to handle an energy body &lt;br>
which is close to me in terms of &lt;br>
relationship or business. All are not expert in handling &lt;br>
all kinds of energy sources and &lt;br>
it is not possible also.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Concept Of Yoga</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/the-concept-of-yoga/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5067-The-Concept-Of-Yoga.jpg" alt="The Concept Of Yoga">&lt;/p>
