&lt;p>In Christianity, what is the biggest sin of Adam and Eve? &lt;br>
They ate the fruit of knowledge. &lt;br>
The Forbidden fruit. &lt;br>
Because of this knowledge, they became aware of their human nature &lt;br>
Following that, they knew their limitation, their emotion, and feeling &lt;br>
They became shy and covered their bodies. &lt;br>
This led to their sex life, &lt;br>
And because of sex, progeny happened. &lt;br>
And we humans are the creation of that.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Is Love?</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-love/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/what-is-love/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5139-What-Is-Love.jpg" alt="What Is Love?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Normally people think love is between opposite genders. &lt;br>
Some people think love is about sex. &lt;br>
There are enough minds who don’t perceive &lt;br>
any difference between this four-letter word &lt;br>
and another four-letter English word. &lt;br>
You know what I mean. &lt;br>
Other people say I love shopping. &lt;br>
There are some who say I love eating, sleeping, dancing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Job Satisfaction</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/job-satisfaction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/job-satisfaction/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5057-Job-Satisfaction.jpg" alt="Job Satisfaction">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Life is a process and in life we do processes &lt;br>
Something is given to us as an input &lt;br>
We do some actions on the given input &lt;br>
And we produce some output &lt;br>
Input is never 100% in our control. But, the quantity and quality of the benefits &lt;br>
depends upon how the output of a process &lt;br>
is perceived by the receiver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mind And Pleasure</title><link>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/mind-and-pleasure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://dasarpai.github.io/wiaposts/mind-and-pleasure/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../assets/images/wiapost/5015-Mind-And-Pleasure.jpg" alt="Mind And Pleasure">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is the mind? Don’t mistake it for the brain. &lt;br>
The brain is physical and it is located inside the physical head. &lt;br>
A perceiving mind is not a matter, but it matters a lot. &lt;br>
This non-matter which matters is not located in one place. &lt;br>
The whole body is the home of the mind.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
