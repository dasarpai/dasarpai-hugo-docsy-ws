&lt;p>In the digital world, scientists are working hard to create machines and robots that can interact with humans the way humans interact with each other. You cannot interact with another human being around if you are not aware of the objects and background around you. There are many ways to know the things around us. We can know them through smell; without looking anything around we can tell, here is a rose flower or samosa or sugar factory around. Without looking we can tell whether a train is coming or going, a person is going or coming, this is a song sung by Lata Mangeshkar. Without looking I can tell this is smooth or rough, hard or soft, cold or hot. In all these cases we could identify the objects and things around us without using our eyes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
