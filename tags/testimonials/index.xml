&lt;p>I have attended Hari Thapliyal’s training on PMP Exam Preparation. Hari is a highly enthusiastic and very experienced professional with in depth knowledge in Project Management. The way he carried out the training program is very unique, interesting, and motivating. The program is bundled with abstract real-life examples and case studies that helped me gain in-depth knowledge in PMP processes and knowledge areas, able to correlate with real-life scenarios. Hari is really blessed with the art of coaching, training, and a spiritual bent of mind. Hari is very keen on following the student’s learning process and offered valuable inputs during the preparation. I am very thankful for having Hari as my PMP trainer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
