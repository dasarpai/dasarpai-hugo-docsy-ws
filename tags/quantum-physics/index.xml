&lt;p>I was a physics student during my college years, and I’ve always loved the subject—even today. However, Quantum Physics, despite all my reading and learning, remains a mystery to me. At this stage, who can teach me Quantum Physics effectively? Finding an able professor, aligning my availability with theirs, and hoping they’d be willing to teach me for free seems impossible. So, I turned to a Large Language Model (LLM) for help. I could have explored other LLMs like Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, and many more. I’m not saying the others are bad, nor am I claiming that ChatGPT is the best at providing plausible answers. Whether an answer is correct or plausible also depends on the learner’s ability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
