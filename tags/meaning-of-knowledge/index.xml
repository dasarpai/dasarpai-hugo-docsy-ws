&lt;p>In the Sanskrit language, there is a word &amp;ldquo;ज्ञान&amp;rdquo; (romanized as Gyan or Jnyana), which translates to &amp;ldquo;Knowledge&amp;rdquo; in English. However, in a worldly sense, when we talk about knowledge, we usually refer to information about something—generally objects, people, processes, or events around us. Sometimes, it also refers to our own body; for a slightly deeper thinker, it includes the mind and ego as well. But for a spiritual seeker, this &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; is not an external thing or &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; at all but the Self.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
