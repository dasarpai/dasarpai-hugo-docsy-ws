&lt;p>Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. There are several types of machine learning techniques, each with its strengths and weaknesses. In this post, we will explore some of the most commonly used machine learning techniques, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and more. This post is not about deep diving into these topics but to give you a oneliner understanding and the difference between these different techniques.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introduction to Neural Network</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Introduction-to-Neural-Network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/Introduction-to-Neural-Network/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6034-Introduction-to-Neural-Network.jpg" alt="Introduction to Neural Network">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A perceptron is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for binary classification. It is a simple model that consists of a single layer of artificial neurons and is used to classify input data into one of two categories. The perceptron algorithm learns the weights of the artificial neurons by adjusting them based on the input data and the desired output. The perceptron is considered a basic building block for more complex neural networks.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
