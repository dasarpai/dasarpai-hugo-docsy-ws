&lt;p>No other models do justice to Sanskrit in terms of context, context length, word meaning, and translation as Grok 3 does. I’ve been trying it since it was launched by xAI on February 17, 2025, and it continues to surprise me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is Hindi the Mother of All North Indian Languages?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/is-hindi-mother-of-all-north-indian-languages/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/wiaposts/is-hindi-mother-of-all-north-indian-languages/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/wiapost/5280-Is-Hindi-Mother-of-All-North-Indian-Languages.jpg" alt="Is Hindi Mother of All North Indian Languages?">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To answer this question, we need to understand that, in a cultural sense, a mother is the one who gives birth to a child; therefore, the child comes later than the mother. Keeping that in mind, Hindi is the daughter of many North Indian languages. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore that a little further.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Road to Bharat LLMs Goes Via Sanskrit</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/the-road-to-bharat-llms-goes-via-sanskrit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/the-road-to-bharat-llms-goes-via-sanskrit/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6218-The-Road-to-Bharat-LLMs-Goes-Via-Sanskrit.jpg" alt="The Road to Bharat LLMs Goes Via Sanskrit">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Since India&amp;rsquo;s independence, the debate over a national language has been intense.
