&lt;p>A digital twin is a &lt;strong>virtual representation&lt;/strong> of a real-world entity or process, created to simulate its behavior and performance. It consists of three main components: representation of the physical entity itself, the digital model that represents it, and the data that links the two (original and twin). Keep in mind the data is generated by model based on the representation of the physical entity. This technology allows users to monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance of physical objects or systems in real-time by providing insights based on data collected from sensors and IoT devices [1][2][3].&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding the Working of CNN</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/understanding-working-of-cnn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/understanding-working-of-cnn/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6213-Understanding-Working-of-CNN.jpg" alt="Understanding the Working of CNN">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we talk about &amp;ldquo;vision&amp;rdquo; capabilities, most people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how complex the brain is in processing the visual spectrum (light signals). What kind of processing happens inside our brain that allows us to understand color, depth, motion, speed, segments, objects, scenes, different kinds of art, drawings, culture, etc.? Until recently, when &amp;ldquo;computer vision&amp;rdquo; became a serious field in AI, only neurology researchers, surgeons, and brain specialists had some insights into these processes. But since 2012 (AlexNet Paper), with new papers being published almost every month, we are constantly learning how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come in computer vision. This article is not only about the chronology of computer vision but also about software engineers, computer scientists, AI engineers, and everyone who wants to understand how their phone performs certain computer visions tasks and becomes intelligent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring AI Benchmarks &amp; Leaderboards</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/exploring-ai-benchmarks-and-leaderboards/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/exploring-ai-benchmarks-and-leaderboards/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6210-Exploring-AI-Benchmarks-and-Leaderboards.jpg" alt="Exploring AI Benchmarks &amp;amp; Leaderboards">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A model is a simplified representation or abstraction of a system, concept, or phenomenon around us. It is used to analyze, understand, predict, or simulate real-world behavior. Models can take many forms, depending on the context in which they are used. For example you also say that I have created a Data Model, Functional Model, UI Model, Simulation Model etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exploring AI Agents</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/exploring-ai-agents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/exploring-ai-agents/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6207-Exploring-AI-Agents.jpg" alt="Exploring AI Agents">&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>🚢 &lt;strong>Cargo Ship vs. Airplane Analogy:&lt;/strong> GPUs are like cargo ships (massive capacity, slower), and CPUs are like jets (fast, versatile, fewer tasks at once).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>⚖️ &lt;strong>Different Strengths:&lt;/strong> CPUs handle operating systems, flexible tasks, and fewer but more complex instructions. GPUs excel at huge amounts of simple, repetitive calculations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🔀 &lt;strong>Parallel vs. General Purpose:&lt;/strong> GPUs are less flexible but highly parallel, CPUs are more general-purpose and can run a wide variety of programs and instructions.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>🔢 &lt;strong>Types of Cores:&lt;/strong>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>⚙️ CUDA Cores: Handle basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication) most commonly used in gaming.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🧩 Tensor Cores: Perform massive matrix calculations for AI and neural networks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>💎 Ray Tracing Cores: Specialized for lighting and reflection calculations in real-time graphics.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>💾 &lt;strong>Graphics Memory:&lt;/strong> GDDR6X chips (by Micron) feed terabytes of data per second into the GPU’s thousands of cores.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🚀 &lt;strong>High Bandwidth:&lt;/strong> GPU memory operates at huge bandwidths (over 1 terabyte/s) compared to typical CPU memory (~64 GB/s).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🔢 &lt;strong>Beyond Binary:&lt;/strong> GDDR6X and GDDR7 use multiple voltage levels (PAM-4 and PAM-3) to encode more data per signal, increasing transfer rates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🏗️ &lt;strong>Future Memory Tech:&lt;/strong> Micron also develops HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) for AI accelerators, stacking memory chips in 3D, greatly boosting capacity and speed while reducing power.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Major players in the AI industry, such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, etc each have their own proprietary models and infrastructure to host these models. They offer AI services that companies use to develop AI products for either their end customers or internal use. Training or developing AI models requires expensive hardware and highly skilled personnel, making it a costly process. However, the deployment and inference stages are even more expensive, as they involve ongoing costs for hardware and monitoring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NLP Tasks</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/nlp-tasks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/nlp-tasks/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dspost/dsp6085-NLP-Tasks.jpg" alt="NLP Tasks">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Processing words of any language and driving some meaning from these is as old as the human language. Recently, AI momentum is taking on many of these language-processing tasks. Here is the summary of these NLP tasks, this list is continuously growing. Researchers keep creating a dataset for these tasks in different languages. Other researchers keep devising new ways to solve these tasks with better performance. They come up with a new architecture, a new set of hyperparameters, a new pipeline, etc. In summary, as of today, there are around 55 tasks. Hundreds of datasets and research papers exist around these.

&lt;p>Prompts can contain questions, instructions, contextual information, examples, and partial input for the model to complete or continue. After the model receives a prompt, depending on the type of model being used, it can generate text, embeddings, code, images, videos, music, and more. Below are &lt;strong>14 examples of good prompts&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data Science, AI, ML, eBooks, PDF Books</title><link>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ds-ai-ml-books/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/dsblog/ds-ai-ml-books/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/dsresources/dsr120-Data-Science-AI-ML-eBooks-PDF-Books.jpg" alt="DS, AI, ML, Books Available">&lt;/p>
