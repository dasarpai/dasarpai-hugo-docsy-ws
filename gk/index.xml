&lt;p>This article trying to help you understand&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why Solstice and Makarsankranti doesn&amp;rsquo;t happens on the same day?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are different movement or rotation of earth?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why there are many seasons on the earth?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="length-of-day-and-night">Length of Day and Night&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#length-of-day-and-night" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In sanskrit Divas is always 24 hours. Duration of day (Din) and night (Raatri) varies every day and it depends upon sunrise and sunset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solstice (अयनांत = अयन + अंत), Equinox (विषुव)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Equinox - An event when day and night are of equal duration. It happens on 20/21-Mar and 22/23-Sep.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solstice - An event when day is the longest or night is the longest. In northern hemisphere, day is longest on 20/21-Jun, Night is longest on 21/22-Dec.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The word &amp;ldquo;tropic&amp;rdquo; refers to a region of the Earth where the Sun appears directly overhead at least once during the year, causing the Sun to be at its highest point in the sky at noon. There are two main tropics:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tropic of Cancer (Karka): This is the northernmost circle of latitude on Earth where the Sun can appear directly overhead at least once during the year. It&amp;rsquo;s located at approximately 23.5 degrees north of the equator.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tropic of Capricorn (Makar): This is the southernmost circle of latitude on Earth where the Sun can appear directly overhead at least once during the year. It&amp;rsquo;s located at approximately 23.5 degrees south of the equator.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When there is Spring (Vasant) in the north hemisphere there is Autumn (Patjhad/fall) in the south and vice versa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Patjhad of Bharat = Fall of USA = Autumn of other English speaking countries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no relationship between Tropic of Cancer (Karka) and Karka Raashi (Cancer Zodiac sign) and Tropic of Capricorn (Makar) and Makar Rasshi (Capricorn Zodiac sign). I need more discussion with expert on this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cancer, Capricorn or any other Zodiac sign are related to the constellation seen in sky from the earth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cancer, Capricorn are two imaginary lines (that makes circle on the northen and southern hemisphere respectably)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Philosophy deals with intellect, logic, reasoning, analysis, and conclusion. It helps you in questioning everything including scientific knowledge, scriptures, traditions, culture, the ways of acquiring knowledge, the existence of God, the existence of your own, and try to understand abstract concepts like Akaasha, Time, the idea of Atman, different states of living like deep sleep, dream and awake. The origin of cosmos, and the origin of life. In fact philosophy deals with every subject in deep and not the obvious dimensions of any subject. That is why the highest degree for all streams of knowledge is called a Ph.D. (Doctorate in Philosophy). It explores the foundations, methods, history, implications, and purpose of science.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Indian Constitution</title><link>https://localhost:1313/gk/The-Indian-Constitution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2022 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/gk/The-Indian-Constitution/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/gk/7004-The-Indian-Constitution.jpg" alt="The Indian Constitution">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An individual has different roles in personal, social, and professional life and s/he exists at the different levels. When one is interacting with others in the family or society or profession s/he is governed by ethics, culture, tradition, etc. All these help in forming rules. Some of these rules may be coming from your religious books and some others are unwritten rules of the family or society. When a state needs to manage its citizen or citizen need to interact with the state there are certain rules that guide interdependence and trust. In earlier times these rules were coming from our religious books or holy man. But over a period of time when states become a republic state where people of different faiths are living then one religious book cannot govern the rule of society and all the citizens. One book which governs all the citizens of a state and the state itself is called Constitution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Classical Literature</title><link>https://localhost:1313/gk/classical-literature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 08:33:00 +0530</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/gk/classical-literature/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/gk/7003-Classical-Literature.jpg" alt="Classical Literature">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main body of classical Sanskrit literature consists of the sacred Hindu collections of poems and hymns known as the Vedas; the commentaries on the Vedas in the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas, and the Upanishads; epic poetry and wisdom literature; and poetry in a style called kavya. In the western sense, the term, usually spelled “classical,” is also used for the literature of any language in a period notable for the excellence and enduring quality of its writers&amp;rsquo; works. My education and upbringing have been in Indian Government schools and Indian villages, therefore, my practical exposure and a natural interest in Bhartiya Classical Literature is much more compared to Western, Arabic, and Chinese literature. During my study, I came across many ebooks and I thought to keep these with me in some shared drive for a quick reference. If you are looking for any of these books you can access them from the link mentioned below. It is a collection of approx 600 books (I keep adding and removing books in this eLibrary). It is approx 7 GB in size.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Indians Are Corrupt - a Rebuttal</title><link>https://localhost:1313/gk/why-indians-are-corrupt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/gk/why-indians-are-corrupt/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/gk/7002-Why-Indians-Are-Corrupt.jpg" alt="Why Indians Are Corrupt">&lt;/p>
