&lt;p>Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s leadership framework, introduced under CEO Satya Nadella, centers on three core principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generate Energy&lt;/strong>: This principle emphasizes inspiring and motivating teams by fostering a positive, collaborative environment where individuals feel engaged and empowered to contribute their best work. &lt;a href="https://jdmeier.com/microsoft-leadership-principles">JD Meier&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Deliver Success&lt;/strong>: Leaders are accountable for achieving results by setting high standards, measuring performance, and continuously seeking ways to innovate and deliver value to customers and stakeholders. &lt;a href="https://jdmeier.com/microsoft-leadership-principles">JD Meier&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Recently I was watching a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/5ZQv0aHVgys">video&lt;/a> about entrepreneurship. This was going viral and people were appreciating the talk. I wanted to analyze and understand what the speaker wants to say, what people are understanding, and what should be learning from the talk. I wrote a paragraph on this, but very soon I realized this deserves more contemplation and an article. In that process, I ended up writing this article. I hope you will get some more insights. Many of you may have different insights and different perspectives, so don’t forget to share your perspective.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/United-Nations-17-Sustainable-Development-Goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 12:14:08 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/United-Nations-17-Sustainable-Development-Goals/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1042-SustaintableDevelopmentGoal.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;table>
 &lt;thead>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;th>&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> Six Sigma Certifications&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>Other Six Sigma Certifications&lt;/th>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;/thead>
 &lt;tbody>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>1. Biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> is the biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications. 6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> has the largest Authorized Training Partner (A.T.P.) network of 2,100+ partners in 90+ countries.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are smaller and not as well-recognized as 6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup>.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>2. Students from 25,000+ companies in 150+ countries&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> has trained/certified more than 750,000 persons in delivering successful projects.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are not as popular or as widely accepted.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>3. Industry-wide acceptance&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>The knowledge gained by getting a 6sigmastudy™ certification is universal in its application and has been applied by organizations in diverse projects spanning an eclectic mix of industries.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma certifications are not accepted in all industries. Most of the time the learning from these certifications applies only to specific industries.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>4. Established name in Six Sigma certifications&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy™’s certification training is provided through its Authorized Training Partners (A.T.P.s) all across the globe. With more than 2,100+ A.T.P.s globally, 6sigmastudy™ has the widest network of accredited training companies offering its certifications. 6sigmastudy™ certifications are widely reputed and accepted by various Fortune 500 companies such as Apple, IBM, HP, Bank of America, AT&amp;amp;T, Dell, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, and PepsiCo.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma certification companies conduct their training through a much smaller network of trainers or training companies, and do not have the same level of credibility in the market that 6sigmastudy™ has.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>5. Active Discussions to share and learn&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> engages the Six Sigma/Lean and Quality Management community through active discussions on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, multiple&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Usually, other certification providers do not have such high activity discussion forums to engage their community.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>6. Multiple free resources for Six Sigma Community&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy™ provides a wide range of free resources such as 5+ hours of high-quality videos, useful case studies, interactive mobile apps, blogs, and articles, thereby contributing to the increased awareness of Six Sigma in the Six Sigma communities.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>No other Six Sigma Certification provides high quality content and free resources to students in multiple formats. The main focus of such certification providers is to get students to their paid classes, rather than help students succeed with best practices.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>7. Free “Six Sigma Yellow Belt” – SSYB™ Course&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Through its free Six Sigma Yellow Belt (SSYB™) Course, 6sigmastudy™ not only introduces Six Sigma concepts to professionals but also helps them get an introductory certification for free. This free certification includes approximately 10 hours of free online self-study through videos, case studies, and guides. The free SSYB™ certification is a great way to introduce Six Sigma to all employees in your organization. &lt;a href="https://dasarpai.com/forms/course-interest/">Enroll in Free SSYB™ Training&lt;/a>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma certifications usually do not provide any free resources or help for students to get a basic idea of Six Sigma concepts. In most cases, professionals are required to pay upfront before even getting their first lesson on Six Sigma.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>8. Credible and standard testing environment&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>With an emphasis on providing candidates with a reliable and credible testing environment, we conduct our certification exams using our live online proctoring system unlike other certifying bodies. This allows you to take your certification exams from the comfort of your home. All exams will be proctored live and videos of the exams will be recorded and reviewed by our assessment team.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma certifications do not have a standardized examination. Most of them only require candidates to be present for a workshop and take a test, the result of which has no bearing on whether the candidate qualifies for the certification. These kinds of certifications never have the credibility companies require to select candidates for key roles.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>9. Teaching methodology&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>6sigmastudy™ A.T.P.s use a scientifically proven and highly interactive teaching methodology including role-plays, case studies, and simulations explaining the key Six Sigma concepts for their Six Sigma certification courses. To ensure an enriching learning experience for all our students, each trainer associated with a 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P. is required to be an accredited 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®).&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Other Six Sigma certification “workshops” are actually lectures. They are not engaging or interactive and most of the times involve delegates (sometimes more than 50 in a class) hearing an instructor for hours without any structured role plays or case studies.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>&lt;strong>10. Experienced 6sigmastudy™ trainers&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Any person who is qualified as a 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®) undergoes a rigorous assessment process and he or she has to exhibit proficiency in the concepts of Six Sigma. All trainers are required to successfully pass two 6sigmastudy&lt;sup>™&lt;/sup> certification exams before they are eligible to teach. Moreover, all feedback from students about their respective trainers is reviewed and all 6sigmastudy™ trainers regularly participate in “Train-the-Trainer” sessions, which help them understand the nuances of our certifications and further cement their understanding of the Six Sigma methodology.&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Usually, other Six Sigma Certifications do not have such strict requirements for trainer accreditation, and thus the quality of their instructors may not be very high.&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>

&lt;p>Six Sigma is a data-driven, customer-focused, and result-oriented methodology that uses statistical tools and techniques to systematically eliminate defects and inefficiencies to improve processes. It is a systematic method to measure and analyze the business processes to identify critical factors affecting business results, thereby improving the processes and establishing controls around the improved processes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is a Technical Spike?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/What-is-a-Technical-Spike/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 06:52:12 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/What-is-a-Technical-Spike/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-technical-spike">What is a Technical Spike?&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#what-is-a-technical-spike" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Estimation is the center of agile planning or sprint planning. But you cannot estimate a user story till the time you know what the work is. Sometimes to understand a user story we need to do some research or exploration. For this, the team needs to put extra effort to understand the business requirement and its technical feasibility. The time allocated for this kind of research may vary from 1-2 days. This activity, when you are trying to understand the user story so that you can estimate it, is called a technical spike. The objective of the technical spike is not to solve the problem or deliver the user story. The output of a technical spike is a through-away prototype. If work done during technical spike should be used for development purpose then this kind of technical spike is called &lt;a href="Tracer-Bullet">Tracer Bullet&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>User Story</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/User-Story/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Feb 2021 02:33:30 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/User-Story/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1036-UserStory.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you are managing a project using agile methodology that time you do not have access to the complete requirements of users. In fact, this is one of the reasons you chose to manage a project using Agile methodology. Therefore, it does not make sense to spend time and try to understand the complete system requirement, document and baseline those to start your project execution. That is never going to happen. In this scenario, how do we understand the requirements?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Agile Project Management for HR Professionals</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Agile-Project-Management-for-HR-Professionals/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:44:57 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Agile-Project-Management-for-HR-Professionals/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1035-Agile-HR-min.png" alt="Agile Project Management for HR Professionals">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>PowerBI is a powerful tool for data analytics. This Business Intelligence tool is developed by Microsoft. This application was originally conceived by Thierry D’Hers and Amir Netz of the SQL Server Reporting Services Team at Microsoft. It was originally designed by Ron George in the summer of 2010 and named &lt;strong>Project Crescent&lt;/strong>. Project Crescent was initially available for public download on July 11, 2011, bundled with SQL Server Codename &lt;strong>Denali&lt;/strong>. Later renamed to &lt;strong>Power BI&lt;/strong> it was then unveiled by Microsoft in September 2013 as P&lt;strong>ower BI for Office 365&lt;/strong>. The first release of Power BI was based on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Microsoft Excel&lt;/a> based add-ins: Power Query, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pivot">Power Pivot&lt;/a> and Power View. With time, Microsoft also added many additional features like Question and Answers, enterprise-level data connectivity, and security options via Power BI Gateways. Power BI was first released to the public on July 24, 2015.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMI ACP Exam</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMI-ACP-Exam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:54:47 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMI-ACP-Exam/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1030-PMI-ACP-Exam-Prep-min.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is speaking? How to be an efficient and effective speaker? Everybody who can open his mouth has a tongue and a healthy vocal cord can speak. But, is everybody able to communicate effectively and achieve the objective of speaking? In this world where we have around 7000 &lt;a href="https://www.education.rec.ri.cmu.edu/fire/naclo/pages/Ling/Fact/num-languages.html">languages&lt;/a>, we had &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-wars-have-been-fought-in-the-last-5000-years">millions &lt;/a>of wars in the last 5000 years of human civilization. Why? Because there are very few effective communicators and none is effective communicator all the time in his personal, social, and business life. Simply opening a mouth and uttering something is not an effective talking or speaking. When one opens mouth and utters unrecognizable words then it is called noise. When one opens mouth and utters sensible words with meaningful sentences it is called speech. The word “speech” is a noun. The process through which we deliver a speech is called “speak”. The word “speak” is a verb. There are many names for this “speech” and “speak”.

&lt;p>In business intelligence (BI) there are two terms, Dimension, and Measures. Dimension is something which can be used for filtering, grouping purpose like department name, employee name, location, severity, priority, etc. The measure is something on which you can perform mathematical and statistical operations like average, sum, minimum, max, etc. Like salary, delay, time to solve a problem, number of tickets, travel expenses, fees, revenue, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interpersonal Skills for a project manager</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Interpersonal-Skills-for-a-project-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 13:12:10 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Interpersonal-Skills-for-a-project-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1027-Softskills-Project-Manger-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To succeed in any profession you need to strike a balance between the art and science of that profession. Science is about processes, practices, techniques, tools, logic, etc. But art is about knowing what else is required to complete the work. It works as a glue between isolated steps, techniques, stages, processes, or practices. To play a melodious guitar we need to ensure strings are not too tight neither too loose. Knowing this balance is art. It is not about measuring the tension of string using some tool but listening to the sound after striking the cord. What combination of color, what stroke, and in what direction will improve the painting is about art. The project management profession is no exception to this art. This is what generally referred to as the Nontechnical skills of the project manager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Team Challenge</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 13:08:54 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Team-Challenge/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1024-Challenge-Team-min.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Karthik is working with the current company for the last 12 years. By virtue of his hard work and initiative, the company has done good progress in the last few years. In reward of this Karthik was also progressing in his career and now he is in a leadership position within the organization. Karthik is a master of his subject and a detail-oriented person. Once he takes work in hand he gets it done by putting in all his efforts and resources at his disposal. The &lt;strong>biggest challenge before Karthik is his own time management&lt;/strong>. He always wants to remain in the driving seat. Because of this attitude, too many people depend upon him and waiting for his time. He has his team of good people but they depend upon Karthik for every small and big decision. Recently Karthik started crashing because of the time required to make all decisions. The team is very happy with Karthik. They appreciate Karthik’s work style, knowledge, attitude, but Karthik wants to delegate some work to his team members and he is not happy with the current attitude of team members.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is Project Management?</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/What-is-Project-Management/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 12:38:04 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/What-is-Project-Management/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1025-pmbok.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Any project is a temporary endeavor that must end on a given day. A project is an investment in a business objective or in some change initiative that is valuable from the sponsor’s perspective. The project’s output needs to justify the money spent by the sponsor and time and energy spent by other stakeholders. Projects should not be done just to keep an organization or person happy or busy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Best Practices of Project Management</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Best-Practices-of-Project-Management/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 14:35:03 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/Best-Practices-of-Project-Management/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1022-IT-PM-Best-Practices-min.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As project managers, we often find ourselves in dual roles: both as customers and vendors. On one hand, we provide services, and on the other, we procure them. Common wisdom tells us that a “&lt;strong>customer is god&lt;/strong>” or a “&lt;strong>customer is king&lt;/strong>.” These phrases imply a sense of superiority of the customer over the vendor, creating an inherent imbalance in the customer-vendor relationship.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMI ACP vs Scrum Master</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMI-ACP-vs-Scrum-Master/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2016 14:15:39 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMI-ACP-vs-Scrum-Master/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1019-PMI-ACP-Scrum-min.png" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why Agile is popular in project management? We know that Agile practices are not new but the relevance of these practices in the 21st century is more. There are 200+ agile practices and all practices cannot be applied to all projects. Due to this reason experts have grouped agile practices and named those groups as different methodology. However the origin of &lt;strong>agile project management&lt;/strong> is in the software industry, but in today’s business environment agile project management is suitable for every industry.

&lt;p>A project manager is a person accountable for accomplishing the project objectives. The project objectives are defined by project stakeholders and they are negotiated and agreed upon with the project manager. Project objectives are related to either of these 6 aspects namely cost, quality, time, benefits, risk, and scope. PMI sees the term “Project Manager” as a “Professional” like Engineer, Doctor, Lawyer, etc. But the industry looks at this term as role or designation. In the eyes of PMI, you may be a project manager within your organization but if you are not rendering project management services to the organization then you are not a project manager. Other times you may not be a designated project manager within the organization but you are rendering project management services for the organization then you are a project manager.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Measure Project Success Criteria</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/How-to-Measure-Project-Success-Criteria/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2016 07:13:56 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/How-to-Measure-Project-Success-Criteria/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1016-Project_Success_Criteria.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

We create our project plan and our team starts working on the new project and again the same problem starts surfacing which was happening in our previous project!

&lt;p>CMMI stands for Capability Maturity Model Integrated. CMMI Version 1.3 came into the market in November 2010. This version has three constellations and they apply to the acquisition, services, and software development industry. CMMI has 4 maturity stages starting from Level 2 to Level 5. Level 1 is considered a natural stage of any organization. In level 2 there are 14 process areas, level 3 there are 21 process areas, level 4 there are 3 process areas, and level 5 there are 2 process areas. But these are the totals of process areas for all constellations. If you are applying for software development then you need not work upon acquisition and services related process areas. In the table below “Y” means for a particular constellation that process area is applicable and “N” means it is not applicable. For example “AM” at maturity level 2 is not applicable for Software Development and Services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMBOK 5 Process Groups &amp; Processes (Acronyms)</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMBOK-5-Process-Groups-Processes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2014 08:11:00 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMBOK-5-Process-Groups-Processes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1010-PMBOK5.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;li>United States spends more than $250 billion each year on IT application development of approximately 175,000 projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>31.1% of projects will be canceled before they ever get completed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>52.7% of projects will cost 189% of their original estimates.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The lost opportunity costs are not measurable, but could easily be in the trillions of dollars.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The failure to produce reliable software to handle baggage at the new Denver airport is costing the city $1.1 million per day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>On average only 16.2% for software projects that are completed on time and on-budget&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In the larger companies, the news is even worse: only 9% of their projects come in on-time and on-budget&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projects completed by the largest American companies have only approximately 42% of the originally-proposed features and functions.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Project is an instrument of change. Hence during the project lifecycle changes are inevitable. Therefore &lt;strong>Change Request in Project Management&lt;/strong> is an extremely important process in any project. Uncertainties in a project can be managed by using the concept of “Progressive Elaboration” and “Rolling Wave Planning” techniques. As a project manager, you must understand that how much agility is affordable and acceptable. For example in a one-year-long project, if you decide that you will make only a monthly plan and not anything beyond this period (because many things can change in one year period), then what is the guarantee that this one-month plan will not change during execution? Absolutely no guarantee!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PMBOK Knowledge Areas</title><link>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMBOK-Knowledge-Areas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Aug 2013 09:19:48 +0000</pubDate><author>nuno@n9o.xyz (Blowfish)</author><guid>https://localhost:1313/pmblog/PMBOK-Knowledge-Areas/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://localhost:1313/assets/images/pmblog/1004-PMBOK-KA-min.jpg" alt="PMBOK Knowledge Areas">&lt;/p>
