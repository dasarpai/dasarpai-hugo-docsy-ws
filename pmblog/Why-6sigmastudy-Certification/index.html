Biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications 6sigmastudy™ is the biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications. 6sigmastudy™ has the largest Authorized Training Partner (A.T.P.) network of 2,100+ partners in 90+ countries. Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are smaller and not as well-recognized as 6sigmastudy™. 2. Students from 25,000+ companies in 150+ countries 6sigmastudy™ has trained/certified more than 750,000 persons in delivering successful projects. Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are not as popular or as widely accepted. 3. Industry-wide acceptance The knowledge gained by getting a 6sigmastudy™ certification is universal in its application and has been applied by organizations in diverse projects spanning an eclectic mix of industries. Other Six Sigma certifications are not accepted in all industries. Most of the time the learning from these certifications applies only to specific industries. 4. Established name in Six Sigma certifications 6sigmastudy™’s certification training is provided through its Authorized Training Partners (A.T.P.s) all across the globe. With more than 2,100+ A.T.P.s globally, 6sigmastudy™ has the widest network of accredited training companies offering its certifications. 6sigmastudy™ certifications are widely reputed and accepted by various Fortune 500 companies such as Apple, IBM, HP, Bank of America, AT&amp;T, Dell, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, and PepsiCo. Other Six Sigma certification companies conduct their training through a much smaller network of trainers or training companies, and do not have the same level of credibility in the market that 6sigmastudy™ has. 5. Active Discussions to share and learn 6sigmastudy™ engages the Six Sigma/Lean and Quality Management community through active discussions on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, multiple Usually, other certification providers do not have such high activity discussion forums to engage their community. 6. Multiple free resources for Six Sigma Community 6sigmastudy™ provides a wide range of free resources such as 5+ hours of high-quality videos, useful case studies, interactive mobile apps, blogs, and articles, thereby contributing to the increased awareness of Six Sigma in the Six Sigma communities. No other Six Sigma Certification provides high quality content and free resources to students in multiple formats. The main focus of such certification providers is to get students to their paid classes, rather than help students succeed with best practices. 7. Free “Six Sigma Yellow Belt” – SSYB™ Course Through its free Six Sigma Yellow Belt (SSYB™) Course, 6sigmastudy™ not only introduces Six Sigma concepts to professionals but also helps them get an introductory certification for free. This free certification includes approximately 10 hours of free online self-study through videos, case studies, and guides. The free SSYB™ certification is a great way to introduce Six Sigma to all employees in your organization. Enroll in Free SSYB™ Training Other Six Sigma certifications usually do not provide any free resources or help for students to get a basic idea of Six Sigma concepts. In most cases, professionals are required to pay upfront before even getting their first lesson on Six Sigma. 8. Credible and standard testing environment With an emphasis on providing candidates with a reliable and credible testing environment, we conduct our certification exams using our live online proctoring system unlike other certifying bodies. This allows you to take your certification exams from the comfort of your home. All exams will be proctored live and videos of the exams will be recorded and reviewed by our assessment team. Other Six Sigma certifications do not have a standardized examination. Most of them only require candidates to be present for a workshop and take a test, the result of which has no bearing on whether the candidate qualifies for the certification. These kinds of certifications never have the credibility companies require to select candidates for key roles. 9. Teaching methodology 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P.s use a scientifically proven and highly interactive teaching methodology including role-plays, case studies, and simulations explaining the key Six Sigma concepts for their Six Sigma certification courses. To ensure an enriching learning experience for all our students, each trainer associated with a 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P. is required to be an accredited 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®). Other Six Sigma certification “workshops” are actually lectures. They are not engaging or interactive and most of the times involve delegates (sometimes more than 50 in a class) hearing an instructor for hours without any structured role plays or case studies. 10. Experienced 6sigmastudy™ trainers Any person who is qualified as a 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®) undergoes a rigorous assessment process and he or she has to exhibit proficiency in the concepts of Six Sigma. All trainers are required to successfully pass two 6sigmastudy™ certification exams before they are eligible to teach. Moreover, all feedback from students about their respective trainers is reviewed and all 6sigmastudy™ trainers regularly participate in “Train-the-Trainer” sessions, which help them understand the nuances of our certifications and further cement their understanding of the Six Sigma methodology. Usually, other Six Sigma Certifications do not have such strict requirements for trainer accreditation, and thus the quality of their instructors may not be very high."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="pmblog"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-02-25T12:10:02+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2021-02-25T12:10:02+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Certifications"><meta property="article:tag" content="Process Management"><meta itemprop=name content="Why 6sigmastudy Certification?"><meta itemprop=description content="Why 6sigmastudy Certification? 6sigmastudy™ Six Sigma Certifications Other Six Sigma Certifications 1.

Biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup> is the biggest accreditation body for Six Sigma certifications. 6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup> has the largest Authorized Training Partner (A.T.P.) network of 2,100+ partners in 90+ countries.</td><td>Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are smaller and not as well-recognized as 6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup>.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2. Students from 25,000+ companies in 150+ countries</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup> has trained/certified more than 750,000 persons in delivering successful projects.</td><td>Other Six Sigma accreditation bodies are not as popular or as widely accepted.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>3. Industry-wide acceptance</strong></td><td>The knowledge gained by getting a 6sigmastudy™ certification is universal in its application and has been applied by organizations in diverse projects spanning an eclectic mix of industries.</td><td>Other Six Sigma certifications are not accepted in all industries. Most of the time the learning from these certifications applies only to specific industries.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4. Established name in Six Sigma certifications</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy™’s certification training is provided through its Authorized Training Partners (A.T.P.s) all across the globe. With more than 2,100+ A.T.P.s globally, 6sigmastudy™ has the widest network of accredited training companies offering its certifications. 6sigmastudy™ certifications are widely reputed and accepted by various Fortune 500 companies such as Apple, IBM, HP, Bank of America, AT&amp;T, Dell, Verizon, Lockheed Martin, and PepsiCo.</td><td>Other Six Sigma certification companies conduct their training through a much smaller network of trainers or training companies, and do not have the same level of credibility in the market that 6sigmastudy™ has.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>5. Active Discussions to share and learn</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup> engages the Six Sigma/Lean and Quality Management community through active discussions on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, multiple</td><td>Usually, other certification providers do not have such high activity discussion forums to engage their community.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>6. Multiple free resources for Six Sigma Community</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy™ provides a wide range of free resources such as 5+ hours of high-quality videos, useful case studies, interactive mobile apps, blogs, and articles, thereby contributing to the increased awareness of Six Sigma in the Six Sigma communities.</td><td>No other Six Sigma Certification provides high quality content and free resources to students in multiple formats. The main focus of such certification providers is to get students to their paid classes, rather than help students succeed with best practices.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>7. Free “Six Sigma Yellow Belt” – SSYB™ Course</strong></td><td>Through its free Six Sigma Yellow Belt (SSYB™) Course, 6sigmastudy™ not only introduces Six Sigma concepts to professionals but also helps them get an introductory certification for free. This free certification includes approximately 10 hours of free online self-study through videos, case studies, and guides. The free SSYB™ certification is a great way to introduce Six Sigma to all employees in your organization. <a href=https://dasarpai.com/forms/course-interest/>Enroll in Free SSYB™ Training</a></td><td>Other Six Sigma certifications usually do not provide any free resources or help for students to get a basic idea of Six Sigma concepts. In most cases, professionals are required to pay upfront before even getting their first lesson on Six Sigma.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>8. Credible and standard testing environment</strong></td><td>With an emphasis on providing candidates with a reliable and credible testing environment, we conduct our certification exams using our live online proctoring system unlike other certifying bodies. This allows you to take your certification exams from the comfort of your home. All exams will be proctored live and videos of the exams will be recorded and reviewed by our assessment team.</td><td>Other Six Sigma certifications do not have a standardized examination. Most of them only require candidates to be present for a workshop and take a test, the result of which has no bearing on whether the candidate qualifies for the certification. These kinds of certifications never have the credibility companies require to select candidates for key roles.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>9. Teaching methodology</strong></td><td>6sigmastudy™ A.T.P.s use a scientifically proven and highly interactive teaching methodology including role-plays, case studies, and simulations explaining the key Six Sigma concepts for their Six Sigma certification courses. To ensure an enriching learning experience for all our students, each trainer associated with a 6sigmastudy™ A.T.P. is required to be an accredited 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®).</td><td>Other Six Sigma certification “workshops” are actually lectures. They are not engaging or interactive and most of the times involve delegates (sometimes more than 50 in a class) hearing an instructor for hours without any structured role plays or case studies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>10. Experienced 6sigmastudy™ trainers</strong></td><td>Any person who is qualified as a 6sigmastudy Certified Trainer (SSCT®) undergoes a rigorous assessment process and he or she has to exhibit proficiency in the concepts of Six Sigma. All trainers are required to successfully pass two 6sigmastudy<sup>™</sup> certification exams before they are eligible to teach. Moreover, all feedback from students about their respective trainers is reviewed and all 6sigmastudy™ trainers regularly participate in “Train-the-Trainer” sessions, which help them understand the nuances of our certifications and further cement their understanding of the Six Sigma methodology.</td><td>Usually, other Six Sigma Certifications do not have such strict requirements for trainer accreditation, and thus the quality of their instructors may not be very high.</td></tr></tbody></table><div class=category-section><h4 class=category-section__title>Categories:</h4><div class=category-badges><a href=https://localhost:1313/categories/pmblog class=category-badge>pmblog</a></div></div><div class=td-tags><h4 class=td-tags__title>Tags:</h4><div class=category-badges><a href=https://localhost:1313/tags/certifications class=category-badge>Certifications</a><a href=https://localhost:1313/tags/process-management class=category-badge>Process Management</a></div></div><div class=td-author-box><div class=td-author-box__info><h4 class=td-author-box__name>Blowfish</h4><p class=td-author-box__bio>A powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo.</p><div class=td-author-box__links><a href target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label></a><a href target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label></a></div></div></div><div class=td-social-share><h4 class=td-social-share__title>Share this article:</h4><ul class=td-social-share__list><div class=social-share><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why%206sigmastudy%20Certification%3f&url=https%3a%2f%2flocalhost%3a1313%2fpmblog%2fWhy-6sigmastudy-Certification%2f" target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
